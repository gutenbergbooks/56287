<h3 id="I_INTRODUCTION"><i>INTRODUCTION</i></h3>

<p><i>Dress is the embodiment of taste and
refinement. A man looks, and is, distinguished,
when he shows simple elegance
in his dress. It is not necessary to have
wealth in order to dress well. With
judgment and economy, one can be something
of a dresser. This book is but a
guide for men who desire to dress, and
are perplexed by the multitude of things
there are to wear, and the ever-changing
styles.</i></p>

<p><i>When a thing becomes vulgarly popular,
then, if you wish to be in dress, as well as
manners, a gentleman, cast it aside, and
seek something newer and less common.</i></p>

<p><i>Dressing may be carried to any extent,
but it is not good taste to do so.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A gentleman is conspicuous for one
thing only—his good taste. Above all
dress are manners and grace. Without
these, one can never be a gentleman.</i></p>

<p><i>In the other part of this work, manners
and customs may be studied.</i></p>

<p><i>A gentleman is a man of taste, culture,
and refinement.</i></p>

<p><i>No man is a gentleman who merely
does the acts of a gentleman. He must
show good breeding—in dress, manners,
and conversation.</i></p>

<p><i>His dress is the perfection of raiment.
His manner is grace and ease personified.
His conversation, knowledge itself.</i></p>

<p><i>Proud, indeed, may the man be who can
write after his name—gentleman.</i></p>

<p><i>Let “Simplex Munditiis” be your
motto for dress.</i></p>

<p><i>Each person must remember one thing:
that, to be distingué in dress, he must
dress, as regards material, richly; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to pattern of cloth, plainly. In other words,
simple elegance shows the gentleman.</i></p>

<p><i>Everything you wear must be immaculate.</i></p>

<p><i>There are three dress divisions of the
day:</i></p>

<p><i>Morning wear.</i></p>

<p><i>Afternoon dress.</i></p>

<p><i>Evening dress.</i></p>

<p><i>The first may be worn any time of
the day before</i> 6 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>, <i>though it belongs
to the morning</i>.</p>

<p><i>The second is not worn before</i> 2 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span></p>

<p><i>The third is not worn before</i> 6 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span></p>

<p><i>The attire for all athletic games, sports,
amusements, for the clergy, and gentlemen
in the army and navy, it is not within
the province of this work to treat of. In
fact, we treat of only that which is worn
by a gentleman at home or abroad, in
summer or winter, when mingling in society.</i></p>

<h3 id="MORNING_WEAR">MORNING WEAR<br />
<span class="smaller">WORN ANY TIME OF DAY</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Indoors or outdoors, morning wear
consists of the following, as the tastes
of the wearer may dictate.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Head.</i>—The black felt derby is the
proper hat for morning. The light brown
in derbys is a pleasing change for spring,
summer, or fall wear. But never be
without a black derby, as it is the hat
worn when not in formal dress.</p>

<p>A derby is never worn with a frock
body-coat, a cutaway body-coat, a Cowes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
body-coat, on a dress body-coat. It belongs
entirely to the walking or sack
body-coat.</p>

<p>Have your hats made to order. You
will be better pleased in the end.</p>

<p>The derby is proper and becoming to
men of all ages. I would caution any one
against wearing such derbys as are of a
pearl, gray, drab, slate, and cigar browns.
These are all in bad taste. The slouch
felt hat is ignored by gentlemen. If a man
desires light shades of derbys, then let
him have them the same shade as the
suit he wears them with.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Hand.</i>—Gloves for morning wear
should be a dark tan, and made of kid.</p>

<p>Heavy weight for the winter months,
and very light for summer.</p>

<p>Raw seams and arrow-back stitching is
the style. Generally one button only on
wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The leading furnishing shops are recommended
for gloves.</p>

<p>If possible, have your gloves made to
order; you are then sure of a perfect fit.</p>

<p>Never wear a glove after it becomes
soiled. It is just as bad as having dirty
hands.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Foot.</i>—Calf-skin, patent leather,
and enamel leather, are used for walking
shoes. They should be made with moderately
thick soles, taper at the toes, and
lace.</p>

<p>It is best to have shoes made to order.
Nothing about a man’s dress is so quickly
noticed as ill-fitting shoes.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Body.</i>—The body-coat: This is a
black sack body-coat, either double or single
breasted. Both styles are correct. The
materials used are thibets, cheviots, and
black serges. At present they are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with four buttons, very wide collars,
and very long in the body.</p>

<p>The waistcoat: This always matches
the body-coat in material and pattern.
Likewise, it may be double or single
breasted. It is not necessary, in this
respect, for it to match the body-coat.</p>

<p>Trousers: These may be of any material
and pattern. They may match the material
of the body-coat, or not, as the taste of the
wearer may dictate. It is better taste to
wear dark trousers with morning wear.
See that your trousers have the proper
cut, and fit perfectly. This is at once the
most difficult to fit, and the ugliest part—if
ill-fitting—of the attire for men. Therefore,
give it the most attention. In order
to have them cut correctly you must rely
on the fashion-plate and its accompanying
directions. Insist on your directions being
followed by the tailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also the cutaway suit for morning
wear. This is worn mostly by elderly
and heavily built men. It consists
of a cutaway body-coat four buttons,
waistcoat single-breasted, and trousers.
These three pieces are always of the same
material and pattern. The same things
are worn with this as with the sack
body-coat.</p>

<p class="sec">Heavy cloths for winter and light
weights for summer wear.</p>

<p>The sack body-coat becomes all men, tall
or short, thin or stout, old or young.</p>

<p>Fancy serge waistcoats, also fine linen
waistcoats, and sashes in summer, may
be worn with the sack body-coat.</p>

<p>Never wear trousers and waistcoat of
one pattern, and body-coat another; it is
exceeding bad taste.</p>

<p>Suits, perfectly correct and very elegant,
are made of selected materials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The sack body-coat, waistcoat, and
trousers are always, in this case, from
the same piece of goods. Some beautiful
materials of light shades are made for
summer wear. For winter wear darker
and slightly heavier materials are used.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>A Morning Promenade Dress.</i>—This
consists of frock body-coat, waistcoat,
and trousers. These three pieces are
always cut from the same material and
pattern. The body-coat and waistcoat
may be single or double-breasted.</p>

<p>Only light shades or patterns of cloths
are used. Never have this promenade
dress in black. The correct head covering
is the black silk top-hat with this
promenade dress.</p>

<h3 id="AFTERNOON_DRESS">AFTERNOON DRESS<br />
<span class="smaller">WORN AFTER TWO P. M.</span></h3>

<p class="sec dropcap"><i>The Head.</i>—A black silk top-hat.
Always of the latest pattern, either
Paris, London, or New-York make. All
are equally stylish. This hat, above all
others, should be made to order; this
being necessary if you desire a fit both
becoming and comfortable.</p>

<p>In this city spring and summer have
light weights. For fall and winter a
slightly heavier hat is made. This is the
only proper hat for afternoon dress in
summer or winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Hand.</i>—Light or dark tan kid
walking gloves are worn. The back
stitching may be black silk or same shade
as the glove. One or two buttons.</p>

<p>Undressed kid gloves, either light or
dark shades, are also worn especially for
afternoon receptions.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Foot.</i>—The leathers used are
patent, and enamel. Laced Bluchers are
worn at this time of day. For summer
wear, the same, or the same leathers
made in ties. Again, I caution you to
pay particular attention to the fit, and
have them made to order. You exercise
your own taste as to the style the shoe is
made in.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Body.</i>—The proper body-coat is
the black cutaway. This is now made
with three buttons, and wide collar cut
low, single-breasted. The material used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
is diagonal. This body-coat should
be of light weight, as it is a dress
body-coat. French Thibets are also
used.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Waistcoat.</i>—This is made of the
same material as the body-coat. It may
be double or single breasted. The
waistcoat should be cut low in front,
that the large puff scarf may be well
exposed. Four buttons.</p>

<p>Waistcoats may be of selected materials
such as fancy serges and fine linens. In
summer white or black silk sashes are
worn.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Trousers.</i>—These should be carefully
selected and well-fitted. The material
and pattern should go well with
black, as this is always the color of the
afternoon body-coat.</p>

<p>Any pattern, checks, stripes, etc., may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
be worn for afternoon dress. Never wear
loud patterns; they are exceedingly bad
taste and rowdyish.</p>

<p>Never wear trousers of the same material
as the body-coat or waistcoat, as it
is not afternoon dress.</p>

<p>Very light patterns may be worn in
summer. In winter slightly darker patterns
are worn.</p>

<p>If pockets are placed in trousers they
are apt to be used; this spoils the set of
the cloth around the hips. Therefore
leave them out if possible.</p>

<p>As a rule, the bottoms of trousers
should be turned up—about two inches—while
walking in the street. Of course,
on a clear day this is unnecessary.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Frock Body-coat.</i>—This is the formal
afternoon dress body-coat. In Paris the
men wear no other.</p>

<p>It is never worn before 4.30 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></span></p>

<p>It is worn at day weddings, at teas,
receptions, and on the promenade.</p>

<p>The material used is the same as in a
cutaway body-coat. Always black goods.</p>

<p>The same things are worn with a frock
body-coat as with a cutaway body-coat.</p>

<p>It is made single or double breasted.</p>

<p>The wardrobe of a gentleman is never
complete without one or more frock body-coats.</p>

<p>The frock body-coat is always worn
buttoned. It is worn in summer, but always
with a waistcoat.</p>

<p class="sec">The cutaway body-coat is worn buttoned
in winter, and may sometimes
be worn with rolled back collar in
summer.</p>

<p>There is also a double-breasted cutaway
body-coat, three buttons, always black.
This is worn more for promenading than
anything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>This can be worn in winter—on mild
days—without a top-coat or greatcoat.
The waistcoat matches it and the trousers
are selected.</p>

<p>Sometimes, for promenading in the
spring, a frock body-coat with waistcoat
and trousers of the same piece of goods
is worn. In this case the material is some
smooth, light-colored pattern.</p>

<p>Again, only a black silk top-hat can
be worn with this frock suit.</p>

<p>This suit is worn without a greatcoat
or light overcoat.</p>

<p>Afternoon dress is worn at day weddings,
afternoon receptions, teas, matinées,
exhibitions of all kinds where ladies are
present, and when promenading with
ladies.</p>

the almost complete blackness of the attire
for this otherwise gayest time of day.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Head.</i>—The black silk top-hat is
supreme and only here, as in afternoon
dress. Same style as that worn for afternoon
dress. The crush opera-hat is entirely
out of style in this city. When
indoors, the top-hat should be carried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the left hand. The exceptions to this rule
are dances, evening receptions, and dinners.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Hand.</i>—The white kid glove goes
with evening dress, and must always
be worn with it, except at or during a
dinner.</p>

<p>The back stitching may be self or black.</p>

<p>Pearl or gray shades are sometimes
worn. No other covering should be worn
on the hand after 6 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span></p>

<p>If one travels through the streets and
on the cars, the best glove to wear—and
perfectly proper—is the black kid glove,
with black stitching, worn only while <i lang="fr">en
route</i>.</p>

<p>Never wear tan-colored or any light
shades of gloves with evening dress, indoors
or out-of-doors. It is bad taste,
and looks, as it is, shoddy. You may
wear white evening gloves at any time
or place after 6 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>, and you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
not complete in your dress unless you
so do.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Foot.</i>—Dancing pumps are little
worn in this city, in fact they are <i lang="fr">passé</i>.
The climate is such, a man could never
be out of his carriage, if he wore pumps,
without risk of a catarrh.</p>

<p>The proper shoe is made of patent
leather, button, kid uppers, and no tips.
This is the shoe for evening dress.</p>

<p>Have them made to order, as that is
the only way to secure a perfect fit.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Body.</i>—The evening dress body-coat
is always of a black material.</p>

<p>A radical change has taken place in the
material used. Dress for evening wear,
especially among young men, no longer
consists of the heavy, stiff broadcloths
and doeskins, but is now made of fine
diagonals, of an almost silky texture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the body-coat above all others.
Much care should be given the fitting and
style. They are made now with shawl
collar, and silk lined. Never wear any
kind of binding on the body-coat. Do
not wear buttons and buttonholes on the
sleeve of body-coat. The styles, changing
each year, should be followed minutely.</p>

<p>In evening dress one must appear a
gentleman, if it is in him at all.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Waistcoat.</i>—Materials used, same
as body-coat, or white silks and black
silks. Patterns selected as taste directs. Of
course the waistcoat is confined strictly to
black or white.</p>

<p>It may be three or four buttons; double
or single breasted. It may be low or
high. Never wear linen waistcoats for
evening dress.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Trousers.</i>—Black, and always the
same material as the body-coat. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
much care is given to the set and fit, as to
that of the body-coat. Leave out pockets.
Wide, black, silk-braided braid is worn
on the outside of trouser-legs. Width of
legs, medium.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Cowes or Tuxedo Body-coat.</i>—This
is for informal evening and home wear.
It is made of the same material as the
dress body-coat. Shawl collar. The
same things are worn with it as with the
dress body-coat. It is worn at home, to informal
dinners, the club, and the theater.</p>

<p>For Sunday evenings this is worn in
place of the dress body-coat, with dress
waistcoat, dress trousers, and black satin
cravat. Again, only the top-hat is worn
with the Tuxedo body-coat.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Knee-Breeches.</i>—These may be worn
in place of dress trousers at any grand
ball, reception, or soirée. They are black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
silk or black satin, or same material as
dress body-coat.</p>

<p>In Paris and London they are much
worn. Patent leather pumps and black
silk stockings are worn. This is the only
change in evening dress, when knee-breeches
are worn.</p>

<p>Of course, in this attire you must
always drive in a closed carriage.</p>

<p>Flowered or figured colored waistcoats,
double or single breasted, may be worn;
white or black preferred. The dress body-coats
may also be in colors as well as
black. An elegant attire, such as this, is
to be worn for grand formal evening
dress.</p>

<h3 id="THE_OVERCOAT">THE OVERCOAT</h3>

<p class="sec dropcap"><i>Greatcoat.</i>—This is a heavy greatcoat,
with or without a cape, as
fashion or taste may decide. Double or
single breasted, long or short. It is worn
during the day only, either over morning
wear or afternoon dress.</p>

<p>It is most fashionable and elegant when
made of some black or dark blue material.</p>

<p>The very latest in this greatcoat is made
thus: very long—five inches below
knee—no fit, without seam in middle
of back—broad shawl collar of black velvet,
single-breasted, dark blue box-cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
It is shoulder-lined with black silk. For
afternoon dress wear only.</p>

<p>One may follow his own taste in selecting
a material for this day greatcoat.</p>

<p>This is made to wear during the coldest
weather. It should be removed immediately
on going indoors.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Light Overcoat.</i>—For fall and spring
wear. This is box cut, made of a light
weight material.</p>

<p>The overcoat for cool days and evening
wear, as over evening dress in summer,
is of some selected black material. The
day overcoat or afternoon walking-coat is
of some light pattern, selected according
to taste of wearer. These overcoats are
now cut very short.</p>

<p>These overcoats are worn over morning
wear or afternoon dress, particularly
the light shades over the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec"><i>Driving Overcoat.</i>—This is a box-coat
cut long or short. Double or single-breasted.
The color should be light, as it
will not show dust.</p>

<p>Heavy material is used for winter and
light for summer driving.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Riding Top-coat.</i>—This is a short
English box-coat. The material is soft and
of medium weight. The color may be
light or dark.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Raglan.</i>—“Lord Chumly,” Inverness,
or sleeveless, greatcoat for evening
wear.</p>

<p>This is the only greatcoat to wear over
evening dress.</p>

<p>It is always black, and with a large, full-length
cape.</p>

<p>There are no sleeves, the cape covering
the arms completely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the perfect greatcoat to wear
over evening dress, as removing and
placing on can be accomplished without
disturbing in any way the dress.</p>

<p>This greatcoat makes up for the ugliness
of the day overcoats in the graceful
appearance it gives the wearer.</p>

<p>It is worn at night only, in the carriage,
or on the street. It is removed on going
indoors.</p>

<p class="sec">Ulsters, fur greatcoats, and greatcoats
with fur collars and cuffs, may be worn
for very cold weather. They are for day
wear only.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Mackintosh.</i>—This is made in
any pattern; the inner lining being rubber.
With or without cape. Double
or single breasted. Light weights for
summer and heavy for winter wear.</p>

<p>It is worn by day only. It may be
worn with morning wear or afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
dress. In the latter a top-hat should never
be worn with a mackintosh. Only a
derby is worn.</p>

<p>In all cloudy, damp, or wet weather
the mackintosh appears.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to carry an umbrella.</p>

<p>The mackintosh should be worn very
long, and rather loose in fit.</p>

<p class="sec">You may follow the fashion-plate as
regards the style your greatcoat or overcoat
is to be made in.</p>

<p>You will discuss with your cutter the
correct thing in seams, linings, buttons,
and pockets. These things are constantly
changing, and therefore have no fixed
rule.</p>

<p>Covered buttons are worn only on light
walking overcoats and evening greatcoats.</p>

<h3 id="ATTIRE_FOR">ATTIRE FOR RIDING, DRIVING, TRAVELING, YACHTING, AND LOUNGING</h3>

<h4>RIDING</h4>

<p class="sec"><i>The Head.</i>—Black derby for winter.
Brown derby for summer.</p>

<p>A cord is attached to the hat, which
may be loosened and made fast to a body-coat
button.</p>

<p>Same style of derby as that used for
morning wear. The silk hat may be
worn for formal riding when without the
top-coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Hand.</i>—Dark tan gloves or gauntlets,
same as morning wear.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Foot.</i>—Riding boots or shoes are
worn, according to taste of wearer.</p>

<p>The leathers used are patent or enamel.</p>

<p>Spurs of nickel or silver plate are worn.</p>

<p>The crop is always carried. This is
silver mounted, and any selected wood.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Body.</i>—A four-button, single-breasted
cutaway of any selected material
and pattern—not black—is the proper
body-coat. Very short skirts. Waistcoat
same, or selected material. High cut;
single-breasted.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Trousers.</i>—They may be long, with
straps.</p>

<p>They may be short—just below knee—buttoned
at side and baggy above
knee. Riding boots or leggings are worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with the knee-breeches, while with the
trousers laced shoes are worn. The leggings
are made to button, strap, or hook.
The most stylish leggings are of the same
material as the breeches.</p>

<p>Trousers or breeches should be of some
light pattern; material should be strong.
They are lined on the seat and inner side
of legs with chamois skin.</p>

<p>For evening rides, as in academies,
the black silk top-hat, white suéde gloves,
single-breasted, black, cutaway body-coat,
and strap trousers of the same material.
Spurs and crop may be worn.</p>

<p>For elderly men the black body-coat
and strap trousers may be worn during
the day.</p>

<h4>DRIVING</h4>

<p>Morning wear is worn for morning
drives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Afternoon drives, if formal, afternoon
dress is worn.</p>

<p>The same rule holds good when you
handle the ribbons, as when the coachman
occupies the box.</p>

<p>The driving overcoat is only worn in
the box seat.</p>

<h4>TRAVELING</h4>

<p>Morning wear is the proper dress for
all travel, be it on ocean or land.</p>

<p>Sack suits, double or single breasted,
are exceedingly stylish and comfortable.
Dark colored material is doubtless the best,
as it does not show the dust and wear of
travel. Heavy cloths for winter and light
weights for summer travel.</p>

<h4>YACHTING</h4>

<p>This is worn on board ship any time
of year. For visiting on shore, a day or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
so, it may be worn, if your temporary
home is the yacht. Heavy material for
winter, and light weights for summer.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Head.</i>—The proper head apparel is the
yachting cap. This may be made in white
or blue flannel, serge, or white canvas.</p>

<p>The yachting cap is for morning, afternoon,
or evening wear, in port or at sea.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Hand.</i>—For all formal affairs on
board ship, white suéde gloves are worn.
In winter or summer, tan kid gloves may
be worn with yachting attire.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Foot.</i>—Either a blue or white canvas
laced shoe or tie, with rubber soles, for day
wear.</p>

<p>For summer evening wear, white suéde
or canvas ties. For the same in winter,
evening dress-shoes.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Body.</i>—For day wear, the double-breasted,
sack body-coat. This may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
blue or white flannel, or serges in blue
or white. Brass buttons are generally
used.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Waistcoat.</i>—This may match the body-coat
in material and color, and cut, or not,
as the wearer desires.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Trousers.</i>—These always match the
body-coat in material and color.</p>

<p>White canvas suits may be worn, but
they are coarse and clumsy.</p>

<p>White trousers may also be worn with
a blue body-coat.</p>

<p class="sec">For formal occasions, evening wear on a
yacht consists of evening dress, as on land.</p>

<p>The silk negligé shirt is worn for day
wear, if preferred to linen.</p>

<p>The ties for day wear are four-in-hands
and cravats, self-tying.</p>

<p>These are in silk, either white, black,
or blue, flowered, figured, or solid colors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>De Joinvilles, also, tied in bow knots,
are worn.</p>

<h4>LOUNGING</h4>

<p>This dress belongs strictly to the summer
months; it is never worn in the city.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Head.</i>—For day wear there is the
white split straw, with white or black
silk bands.</p>

<p>Also, the yachting cap, in white or
black. This is made of flannel, or a
material matching the lounging suit.</p>

<p>These hats are worn for tennis, walking,
driving, riding, day receptions, lawn
parties, etc. However, these hats are
never to be worn in the city.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Hand.</i>—White suéde gloves are
worn with lounging suits, when walking
or driving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Foot.</i>—White canvas, white suéde,
tan or white buckskin, and patent leather
ties, are worn with lounging suits.</p>

<p>For tennis, and games on the lawn,
canvas, or suéde, or buckskin shoes, or
ties, with either felt or rubber soles, are
used.</p>

<p>Have these shoes fit, and look as neat
as possible.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Body.</i>—First the material—this
may be serge or flannel—though the latter
is out, for the reason that it is more
heating than serge—these are always full
white.</p>

<p>It consists of a long or short sack
body-coat, waistcoat, and trousers. The
body-coat may be single or double
breasted.</p>

<p>The waistcoat may match the body-coat
in cut and material or not. Fancy
patterns may be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Trousers are always the same material
and color as the body-coat.</p>

<p>Have the cut loose, and almost flowing.</p>

<p>The trousers may have a stripe at the
side. No pockets.</p>

<p>Lounging suits may also be made up in
some selected pattern, as small checks or
narrow black stripes. But there is nothing
so rich as the solid white lounging
suit.</p>

<p>The sash or kummerbund.—The length
is from four to five yards. Always tie
your sash—never wear those cheap, common
made-ups.</p>

<p>A sash may be worn any time of day.
The material is always silk. Never wear
any but solid colors. Black silks and
white silks are the most elegant and correct.</p>

<p>Sashes of maroon or dark blue are
sometimes worn. The ends hang over
the left hip, and should be evenly tied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The sash is worn with a lounging suit,
morning wear, afternoon dress, and evening
dress.</p>

<p>The white sash is worn with a white
lounging suit and evening dress only.</p>

<p>The negligé shirt is made of silk, or
cheviots. However, this is no longer
worn by young gentlemen of fashion.</p>

<p>A word about this shirt—it is doubtless
very comfortable, and can be worn longer
than linen, but it is not as cool as linen,
nor does it look as well about the neck.</p>

<h3 id="HOUSE_WEAR">HOUSE WEAR</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The formal dress is the same as that
worn at any other house.</p>

<p>In the privacy of your rooms, however,
you change this attire for something that
is loose and comfortable.</p>

<p>Sack body-coats of selected materials
are used. The trousers are of some black
or blue material, as selected.</p>

<p>There is also the smoking jacket and
the poker jacket—these are in many
varieties of material and pattern.</p>

<p>Again, we have the short and the long
dressing-gowns. There are many patterns
to choose from.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Before and after the bath, the bath-robe
is put on. This differs from the silk
dressing-gown in being made of Turkish
toweling. No part of man’s attire is more
brilliant or beautiful than this robe. The
comfort experienced in wearing is only
equaled by its delicate and beautiful colors.</p>

<p>For the feet we have the slipper; this
may be any leather and style your taste
desires. Slippers are also made to match
the bath-robe in material and pattern.</p>

<p>You must not wear any of these things
out of the privacy of your own apartments.</p>

<p>For a lunch at home you would wear
morning wear; a reception or tea, afternoon
dress; evening affairs, evening dress.</p>

<p>It is as necessary—in fact, it is due—when
acting the part of the host to look
your best as when you are a guest.</p>

<p>When you dine at home evening dress
is always required.</p>

loose fitting sack coat, and loose
fitting trousers.</p>

It should always be made to order,
if a fit is desired.</p>

<p>The shirt opens in front only. You
may have two or three buttonholes in the
bosom.</p>

<p>The collar and cuffs are attached. Never
wear detachable collars and cuffs.</p>

<p>This shirt with the plain bosom is worn
for morning wear, afternoon dress, evening
dress, or any other wear during the
day. The same style of shirt is worn
winter or summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Very elegant shirts are made for evening
dress, consisting of embroidered bosoms
or frills of linen. With each change
of wear the linen should also be changed.</p>

<p>At least three changes a day are made.</p>

<p>The style of the collar. This may be very
high, or medium, as your taste directs.</p>

<p>The cuffs should extend to the first
thumb-joint. Cuffs are made with round
or square edges.</p>

<p>The high, or standing, collar is worn
with morning wear, afternoon dress, evening
dress, and all other dress.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Handkerchief.</i>—This is of pure
white linen, with white borders.</p>

<p>Embroidered or not, as taste dictates.</p>

<p>The same style is carried with morning
wear, afternoon dress, or evening dress,
or any other wear.</p>

<p>The upper left outside pocket is the
place to carry it, except in evening dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when it is carried in the left or right side
upper inside waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>The handkerchief of silk is carried with
evening dress only. It is carried in the
right hand while dancing, and worn in
the shirt front.</p>

<p>It may be any pattern desired. White
silk is always the body, the border only
being colored.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The neckerchief.</i> This is of silk, selected
as to color and pattern. This is worn
around the neck with greatcoat during
cold weather.</p>

<p>It is not a good thing to wear, as far as
health goes.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to the stylish dresser.</p>

<p>A gold pin may be worn in a neckerchief.</p>

worn now by the dressers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The material used is linen or silk, always

shades may be worn, if desired. They
should match the underwear.</p>

<p>For evening dress, white or black only.

silk. Other colors may be worn.</p>

<p class="sec">Underclothing should be changed at
least twice a day. Silk is worn always
with evening dress. Indulge in baths as
frequently as possible.</p>

<h3 id="THE_ART_OF_DRESSING_THE_COLLAR">THE ART OF DRESSING THE COLLAR</h3>

<p class="dropcap">In ties, cravats, and scarfs we have two
colors—these are the principals. They
are black, and white. With these, combined
or separate, the most elegant scarfs
are made. They may be figured or flowered,
or solid colors. The materials used
are silks, crêpes, satins and lawn.</p>

<p>The patterns—with black or white as
a background—are innumerable.</p>

<p>Use all the taste you can command in
selecting ties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember that black is your principal
body-coat color, and select your ties
accordingly. At the same time you must
not have the color or pattern of the tie at
war with that of the waistcoat or trousers.</p>

<p>Never wear those flaming ties, or shades
that remind you of the colored paper sold
in shops.</p>

<p>But a gentleman need not be cautioned
in this, for he has or will acquire taste.</p>

<p>Besides black or white it is permissible
to wear such shades of maroon, green,
blue, violet, as are of a rich but quiet
style. These are only worn with morning
wear.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>For Morning Wear.</i>—Cravats, four-in-hands,
and puff scarfs. All self-tying.
These may be black, white, or any of the
before-mentioned shades. In silks and
black satin. Gold pins are worn in the
scarfs. It is the acme of ugliness to wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pins in a four-in-hand, besides being vulgar.
The four-in-hand may be tied in the
regulation style or in the form of a bow.</p>

<p>Never wear a made-up bow, scarf, or
four-in-hand. They look cheap, and they
are vulgarly common.</p>

<p>Then there is the bow or cravat, tied
in the regular bow-knot.</p>

<p>Black is the richest and most elegant
color for morning wear.</p>

<p>The same styles are worn in summer
as in winter. In summer much of the
bosom is allowed to show; while in winter
it seldom or never shows, excepting
evening dress. Wherever and whenever
morning wear is used, any of these ties
may be worn.</p>

<p>For riding, driving, traveling, yachting,
and lounging, the ties for morning wear
may be worn.</p>

<p>Very elegant, large cravats—tied in a
bow-knot, or as a four-in-hand—are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from De Joinvilles; either in black satins
or black silks, or dark shades of silk.</p>

<p>The De Joinville is folded by yourself or
your furnisher. It may be sewed or not.
This De Joinville cravat is for morning
wear only. Always have your ties, cravats,
and scarfs made to order. This is
the only way to keep them uncommon.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Afternoon Dress.</i>—Here is the chance
for the greatest amount of display. Diamond
pins, and large, white, puff scarfs
tied and pinned in shape by yourself,
are worn with the cutaway body-coat
or the frock body-coat.</p>

<p>In winter the large puff scarf only is
worn with afternoon dress.</p>

<p>In summer, four-in-hands—either in
bow or regular tie—as well as the puff
scarfs are worn. With a sash—a bow
tied or a four-in-hand tied, its ends placed
in the opening of the bosom, is worn. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
scarf may be worn with a sash when the
body-coat is not worn open.</p>

<p>Waistcoats should be four buttons, and
body-coats cut low in collars in order to
show the beauties of the huge puff scarf
now worn.</p>

<p>Silk is the material for the white scarf.</p>

<p>Satin is only allowable in black and dark
shades for scarfs.</p>

<p>Exquisite silk or crêpe puff scarfs consisting
of white background with figures
or flowers of a violet, blue, purple, maroon,
etc., as your taste directs, are worn.</p>

<p>Remember, simplicity for morning
wear—elegance for afternoon dress.</p>

<p>For house wear the black silk or satin
four-in-hand is the neatest tie worn.</p>

<p>The Ascot form of tying a scarf is seldom
used now.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Evening Dress.</i>—Full evening dress requires
the white lawn cravat—self-tying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Long and wide is the most elegant.</p>

<p>Once or twice around may be worn.
For wear with Tuxedo or Cowes body-coat,
or the dress body-coat at informal
affairs, theater, club, or home dinners, the
black satin cravat—self-tying—is the
proper thing. It may be once or twice
around as you like. Never wear this
cravat with a white waistcoat or white
sash.</p>

wear, afternoon dress, but never
with evening dress.</p>

<p>The styles are ever changing. Sticks
are worn in summer and winter. In
selecting sticks do not take the extremes
in heavy or light. Never have any metal
but silver—it is the most elegant.</p>

<p>Among the best dressers and beaus of
this city the walking stick is no longer
carried or worn, either with morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
wear or afternoon dress. As went the
rapier so goes the walking stick.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Umbrella.</i>—This is worn only in
doubtful or wet weather.</p>

<p>It is worn at any time of day. Silver
is the only proper metal. The material
should be silk or part silk. Never wear
the case in the street.</p>

reason for black being the demand of
superstitious custom.</p>

Evening, evening dress.</p>

any other suitable material. Silk should
always be worn with evening dress.
White is the neatest color that can be
worn.</p>

<p>Suspenders are worn with every dress,
summer or winter, with or without a
sash. Each pair of trousers should have
its individual suspenders. Great care
must be used in adjusting the suspenders;
if not, the trousers will set awkwardly.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Uppers, or Overgaiters.</i>—This article
is becoming somewhat obsolete here.
They are worn in the street only. They
may be worn over any shoe or tie. For
traveling or walking only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>On entering the house they should be
removed. If worn, they should always
be made the same as the trousers, in
material and pattern. They spoil the set
of the trousers in the legs. They are also
clumsy. They are some protection to the
trousers in muddy weather. They may
be worn summer or winter.</p>

<p>Uppers may be worn with morning
wear, afternoon dress, or evening dress.
Black cloth uppers may be worn during

Silk fob for morning wear. Gold for

<p>As many rings as he cares to possess.
Rings are not worn with evening dress;
only in the afternoon. In fact, it is not
fashionably necessary to wear rings.</p>

<p>The buttons used in the shirt bosoms
are of gold set with precious stones.
Diamonds are the most elegant.</p>

<p>Plain gold buttons are worn with morning
wear.</p>

<p>Stonine studs or buttons, in fact all
studs, are out of style.</p>

<p>For the sleeve or cuff: gold buttons are
used for all wear.</p>

<p>Any number of gold pins for the scarfs.
These may be plain gold or set with
precious stones; diamonds, of course,

manicure set, soaps, washes and
toilet lotions, wash-cloths, brushes and
picks for the teeth and gums, and shaving
outfit.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Rubbers.</i>—Rubbers or goloshes are
worn, if desired; but only while walking
in the street. It is much better to
have a heavy pair of laced-shoes for mud
or snow. Of course, when there is ice
on the walks, it is necessary to wear rubbers,
if you do any walking. Rubbers,
when walking, may be worn over evening
dress shoes.</p>

evening dress body-coat. A white lawn
cravat and white silk waistcoat are worn
with it.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Cloth Bands for Top-hats.</i>—Wide black
cloth bands are now worn on the silk top-hat,
afternoon or evening. For riding or
driving.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Wigs.</i>—The wearing of wigs is a custom
of the past. Whether it is to be revived
or not the future alone will show.</p>

<p>It is perfectly proper for a bald man to
wear a wig. There is no reason in his
hiding the fact either. A young man may
wear a wig if he is prematurely bald. He
certainly will make his appearance more
presentable to others by so doing.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Opera Glass.</i>—A gentleman may carry
one to the theater or opera—evening or
afternoon. The small opera glass is most
convenient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

the left breast.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Fans.</i>—These may be carried at any
evening reception by a gentleman, if he
desires to so do, when there is to be
dancing.</p>

<p>Folding fans, with a heavy black or
white silk cord and tassel, are recommended.</p>

<p>As a rule, fans are carried only for
summer dances. A gentleman will find
it convenient and comfortable to have
his own fan.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Knee-buckles and Shoe-buckles.</i>—These
are of sterling silver. Buckles may be
worn when knee-breeches are worn.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Trousers Crease.</i>—This may be worn
in trousers or not as taste dictates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>It certainly improves the set of the trousers,
and keeps the knees straight.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>Pockets.</i>—These appear only in the
waistcoat and body-coat. The only things
carried—morning wear, afternoon dress,
and evening dress—are the linen kerchief—including
the silk when in evening
dress—money, watch, and fob chain
in silk or gold, cards, pencil, silver or gold.</p>

<p class="sec"><i>The Monocle.</i>—This is worn any time
of day. Narrow black silk ribbon or cord
is worn on it for morning and afternoon.
For evening a wide black silk ribbon is
used.</p>

<p>Wearing a monocle is an English custom.</p>

<p>The monocle is seldom worn in this
city. When worn it is placed in the right
eye.</p>

<h3 id="CLOSING_REMARKS">CLOSING REMARKS</h3>

<p>A gentleman in ordering his apparel,
whether for morning wear, afternoon
dress, or evening dress, will follow his
own taste and desire as regards the
style of seams, the material and style
of linings, the size, number, and kind
of buttons to be used, the number of
pockets, the length of body-coats, overcoats,
length and width of trousers, the
style of his hat, gloves, and shoes, the
length of sleeves and width of collars, use
of braids and bindings, use of collar facings,—in
fact, every point connected with
the making of garments, both outer and
under clothing, hats, shoes, gloves, and
ties, all these he must decide and order
the maker to follow out.</p>

<p>It is only through this care and attention
to details that he can show his taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and ability to dress. Most important
of all—especially in clothing—is the
selection of material.</p>

<p>This completes the dress necessary for
a gentleman of fashion, in society or out.
He is not asked to follow implicitly the
rules as laid down here, but rather follow
his own taste and ideas in the making
and wearing of garments.</p>

<p>This is only meant as a guide. It is
believed to be correct in all its details, and
can be followed safely as such.</p>

<h3 id="II_INTRODUCTION"><i>INTRODUCTION</i></h3>

<p><i>Before entering upon my subject, I would
first state that this work is unlike former
books on manners and etiquette, for it seeks
not as in those cases to establish rules, enjoining
the reader to be controlled thereby,
nor does it define customs and force them
upon his knowledge. It merely touches
upon usages of sufficiently long standing
to constitute customs of society, reviews them
before his mind, and classes them as faults
if not properly practised, and gives the
remedies of those faults. Also it defines
customs which are practised too exactly to
appear natural, and shows wherein they can
be modified. In this work there are no
monotonous rules imperatively laid down
and the subjects are not tiresomely strained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The most important customs only are described,
with their modifying rules; and
though the work may say what should be
done or omitted, yet it leaves it to the option
of the reader whether or not he will
perfect his social training by a recognition
and due exercise thereof.</i></p>

<p><i>To classify the subjects under two general
heads, I would first speak of “Appearance.”</i></p>

<p><i>There is no necessity for a gentleman to
give opportunities for others to criticize
his appearance. There is no reason why a
gentleman should not at any and all times
present a complete and neat attire. Dress,
extravagant or plain, can always have such
an effect, if care and taste are exercised.
If he is in doubt as to his own ability to
dress tastefully, then he should submit himself
to tuition, or, if he is too proud to disclose
his ignorance in the matter, he should
take careful notice of the appearance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
good taste displayed by others, and endeavor
to gain knowledge therefrom. In order to
carry out my advice, it is only necessary
that a gentleman should either possess or
acquire good taste, and refer entirely to
styles established by custom, as elucidated
in Part 1. of this book.</i></p>

<p><i>The second head of customs is “Manner.”
For a gentleman should not present a
perfect appearance as to dress, and at
the same time accompany his good taste
with bad or impolite manners. A gentleman
should have a thorough knowledge
of polite manners as established by custom,
such as are defined in this work. I mention
only the most important ones, it being
immaterial to go into the minor branches
of etiquette and manners, as they naturally
follow in consequence of a due exercise
of the more important ones. It is a
very simple matter to cultivate easy and
graceful manners, and just as easy to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
those manners in a polite and gentlemanly
way, no matter how or under what circumstances
one may be placed in society.</i></p>

<p><i>And now I think my reader is prepared
for a perusal of what I would term not a
classification of rules, but a kind of outline
history of customs as they should be
recognized.</i></p>

<h3 id="ACTIONS_INDOORS">ACTIONS INDOORS</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> A gentleman should never
leave his room without a complete attire,
as it is essential that he present the same
appearance before a servant as a lady.
The same rule should apply when he
risks encountering unknown gentlemen,
or acquaintances, as it should be his desire
to receive respect at the hands of both
sexes.</p>

<p class="sec">2. If passing up or down stairs or
through halls, a gentleman should take
care not to tread heavily; especially is this
urged in hotels, when it is found necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to pass through hallways late at
night.</p>

<p class="sec">3. When about to ascend or descend a
narrow stairway, if a lady is discovered
thereon, step aside and allow her to pass;
your act thus permitting her free way
without the discomfort of turning, as
would follow if both met thereon.</p>

<p>If with a lady, in ascending or descending
a narrow stairway, always precede
her, putting a distance of at least four
steps between. If on a broad stairway,
allow her to occupy a place next the balustrade,
placing yourself at her other side.</p>

<p class="sec">4. Not under any consideration should
a hat be worn in a house or church; never
in a theater till the play is over, when it is
allowable, as established by custom, on
account of the draft following the opening
of the exits, and not in a hotel except in
the office or smoking-rooms thereof. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wearing of a hat is also permissible when
lingering or detained in the draft of any
open exit to the street.</p>

<p class="sec">5. The body-coat should never be
removed in the presence of ladies, no matter
how ready they may be to approve of
the act, unless it is their express and
unanimous desire, in which case the better
policy, in choosing between the alternative
of positive rudeness and a fall of dignity,
is to take the course requested.</p>

<p class="sec">6. An overcoat should never be worn
in a private house unless the temperature
is such as makes the act compulsory in
order to preserve the health, and then
only on receiving approval from the majority
of those ladies (only) who may be
present. It is immaterial if it be worn in
a hotel, exceptions being made to the
parlors, ball-room, dining-rooms or apartments.
The overcoat should be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
immediately on entering a theater or music
hall if the intention is to remove it at all, as
it is the height of rudeness to rise in the
seat to remove it if the act cause discomfort
to, or obscures the view of, parties
occupying rear or adjoining seats.</p>

<p class="sec">7. (<i>a</i>) Never add to your comfort by
making your appearance displeasing to
others. And under this head I would
state that the pockets of either coat, vest,
or trousers should never be bulged out
with articles so as in any way to spoil the
effect of neatness and cut of the clothing.
(<i>b</i>) The clothes should not be allowed to
wrinkle; if carefully worn, or when not in
use hung smoothly on stretchers, wrinkles
can be avoided. (<i>c</i>) The hands should
never be carried awkwardly, and especially
must care be taken to keep them out
of the pockets; such habits mar the appearance
of the gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">8. Cards.—(<i>a</i>) If calling upon one
young lady, only one card should be
delivered at the door; if on two ladies,
two cards are required. It is unnecessary
that more than two should be sent
up, even if the call is made on the
whole family. This rule applies, also,
in delivering cards at receptions, teas, afternoon
musicales, and the like. Always
send cards on occasions when you cannot
attend in person. When calling upon
ladies visiting a card should also be sent
to their hostess.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The card should always have the
gentleman’s address on the right hand
lower corner; or, if he has no permanent
place of residence, then the name of
his club, or of some person in whose
care communications can be forwarded
to him. If his name has too many initials
to permit of using the Christian
name, then “Mr.” should be used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and only the initials placed before the
surname; but otherwise, the use of
“Mr.” is according to taste, whether it
be placed before the Christian name or
omitted, though the latter is advised.</p>

<p class="sec">9. Calling should be confined entirely
to the afternoon and evening; a few
exceptions can be made in the case of
very dear friends, when a call in the
morning would not be out of the way.
Such should be made between the hours
of eleven and one. Afternoon calls should
be made from three till five, exceptions
being made on occasions where the lady
is in the habit of having five o’clock tea,
when it is allowable for the gentleman
to stay till his cup or two cups are
finished; on no account is he to partake
of more than two. Ordinary evening
calls extend from eight to ten and are not
to be made later than eight-thirty. For no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
reason whatever should a gentleman stay
later than ten, unless he is calling upon
his fiancée; the evening receptions extend
from eight to eleven, and the call must be
made before ten.</p>

<p>When pressed to remain to a meal,
unless at least five or six calls have previously
been made, he should decline the invitation,
exceptions being permitted when
the young lady’s parents or guardians are
on intimate terms with his own, in which
case the second call will justify him in
accepting. Intimacy between her brothers
or sisters and your own will not
suffice. The card is delivered at the
door, and while waiting for the lady,
enter the parlor. It is not necessary to
remove the overcoat until the butler announces
whether or not she is at home
and can see you; whereupon, if she acknowledges
your card, the overcoat, hat,
cane and overshoes are to be left in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
hall; on no account leave them about the
parlor. It is not necessary to remove
the gloves. This rule applies in all cases
where ordinary calls are in question; if
merely on a mission to occupy but a few
moments, the overcoat may be kept on,
and the cane carried in the hand, but the
hat must always be left upon the rack.</p>

<p>Always rise and advance to meet a
lady at the door; do not subject her to
the inconvenience of discovering you and
coming to you herself. If the lady seats
herself upon a sofa, do not place yourself
beside her without first obtaining
her consent. If you take the seat, be
careful of your position, and do not appear
too easy and at home, and, above
all, do not cross the legs. Also, keep
the hands as quiet as possible; don’t
handle any objects or toy with ornaments,
or twist your watch-chain, for
it shows you are either nervous or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
fidgety, and you thereby produce the
nervous effect upon your companion.
The conversation should be of a sensible
topic; or, if amusing, it should be at
least interesting: the best topics to
converse upon being theaters, plays,
society, picture exhibitions, art, buildings,
literature, and especially light
gossip. Travels may also be discussed,
but first ascertain of the lady whether
she has traveled; if not, and she does
not ask you to recite your travels, and
it is your desire to do so, then describe
them as briefly as possible. If you find
a young lady begins to appear restless,
say a few words more and take your
departure; there is no knowing but that
she has some other engagement. Never
at any time speak of an acquaintance in
a disagreeable manner. Do not even say
anything unguardedly about a third person,
for fear that the trait or action you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
describe may disclose to your companion
of whom you are speaking. These last
two cautions may seem of minor importance,
but they are, on the contrary, very
important, as thousands of serious quarrels
result from neglecting them.</p>

<p class="sec">10. When in company, do not by word
or action make yourself obnoxious to
those present. Your words should be
well chosen and spoken at the proper
time, and in good grammar; omit slang.
If of a joking frame of mind, deliver your
joke in a quiet way, and do not carry
your ability too far; for too much of a
good thing is worse than none at all.
A few good jokes, delivered with telling
effect, will do more for your reputation
in that line than a thousand poor ones
improperly delivered. No man should
laugh at his own joke, and when doing
so at others’ he should take care not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
be boisterous. Do not monopolize the
conversation; it cannot be done without
interrupting others, and to do that is the
height of rudeness. When in company,
and persons are talking, do not pick them
up on any statement of which you do
not approve, and pointedly contradict
them, nor start any argument which
would tend to their embarrassment.
Never flatter or compliment in company,
as it makes the object of your attention
feel conspicuous, and those present imagine
that they are of less importance in
your estimation. Do not ask a young
lady to attend any entertainment with
you, or do not extend any invitation if
another lady be present, with whom you
are even but slightly acquainted; your
partiality for one should never be disclosed
to another. Unless you can do it gracefully,
do not execute a dance or attempt
to imitate stage performers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Also take care not to upset or run into
ornaments or stub the toe against them,
and be sure of your footing, that you do
not trip on mats, etc. A great many
gentlemen imagine it to be necessary to
back out of a room on taking their departure;
not so,—merely say “good-by”
(or “good-morning,” or words suited to
the time of day), and, turning to the door,
walk out to the hallway. If the hostess
has an inclination or desire to follow you
and continue any unfinished subject which
may have been under discussion, it is not
necessary to retire in so awkward a manner.
Promptly announce your intention
and enter the hall; while adjusting the
overcoat and gloves, the conversation can
be continued. This method can be exercised
without the faintest appearance of
rudeness.… Subjects to be carefully
studied for company use may be found
under the head of “Conversation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">11. If you are at a special invitation
afternoon tea or reception, pay particular
attention to the hostess whenever she is
seen unoccupied, and offer your company
in escorting her to partake of refreshments.
Always eat lightly of the viands
yourself. If a crowded reception, half an
hour only should be spent thereat. A
reception call should be made within three
months thereafter; half an hour, or possibly
three-quarters, is proper for such a call.</p>

<p class="sec">12. A gentleman should never enter
his sister’s luncheon hall when the repast
is in progress; such intrusions prove
fatal to topics of dress generally under
discussion, or other matter not intended
for his ears. A gentleman can give a
stag luncheon, or a luncheon for both
ladies and gentlemen if a chaperon presides.</p>

<p>Under this head informal lunches may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
also be discussed. These are such as
persons are apt to partake of without
any special previous arrangement, either
at restaurants or private houses. As a
gentleman is at liberty to dine where he
pleases, I only speak of the subject in
connection with ladies.</p>

<p>A gentleman should never invite a lady
to lunch at his own house, no matter
how well acquainted he may be with
her, not even when engaged, unless a
chaperon be present at the meal, and not
invite her at all unless he has met her
very frequently beforehand.</p>

<p>A gentleman can accept an invitation to
lunch with a lady under the same conditions
as those of an invitation to stay to
dinner when calling (see Sec. 9.)</p>

<p>When desirous of asking a lady to
lunch at a restaurant, whether you take
her direct from the house to it, or while
walking, makes no difference; a chaperon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
must be present at the meal unless you
bear an existing or agreed future relationship
to her, or your friendship is understood
by your own and the lady’s friends
to be so dear as not to allow of suspicion
or question—when a chaperon can be
dispensed with.</p>

<p>Without a chaperon be extremely careful
in your selection of a restaurant; seek
those whose reputation is quiet and refined
and of less publicity than the rest of
the well-known restaurants. Always
when with a lady enter the restaurant
by the door intended for ladies’ use; never
by the public entrance.</p>

<p class="sec">13. Evening parties should be attended
before the hour of eleven, in full dress. If
with a lady do not keep her waiting, but
rather let her find you awaiting her at
the dressing-room door. If alone or
otherwise take care to seek the hostess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
on entering the parlor; this is a piece of
politeness sadly overlooked nowadays,
especially by individual gentlemen. At
a dance always take the inside arm of a
lady while promenading. Repeatedly ask
after her thirst, and never allow her to
approach the refreshment table, but bring
the glass to her on your kerchief if there
are no doilys. Always pay particular attention
to the hostess, and ask her repeatedly
to dance. Never, if idle and you
see her without a partner, allow her to
remain thus alone; under such circumstances,
likes and dislikes should be set
aside, or you should not have attended
the dance. Always offer your arm to
your partner immediately on ceasing to
dance. Make it a rule never to leave a
dance without bidding the host or hostess
good-night, and thanking them for the
pleasures of the evening. This is another
poor policy of a great many men, to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
quietly without the knowledge of the host
or hostess.</p>

<p>Party calls should be made within a
year at the farthest after the party, and
should occupy the same length of time
as an ordinary call.</p>

<p class="sec">14. Dinners should be attended promptly
on time. Always allow the ladies to be
seated first. Do not attempt to pass anything
if the servants are present, nor even
if they are not present unless expressly
requested to do so.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to speak when the
mouth contains food. When spoken to,
a motion of the head will be sufficient to
convey the reply intended, and at the
same time to acquaint your questioner
with the fact that he has spoken inopportunely.
In order to conform to the various
customs it is advisable to abstain as
long as is prudent from folding the napkin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
till you view the action therein of the
host or hostess. But this is only necessary
at more or less informal dinners.
The prevailing custom of formal dinners
is never to fold the napkin. Care must
be taken not to make noises with the
mouth, when eating, and not to smack
the lips. If a total abstainer from drink,
you must not turn your glasses upside-down,
nor allow them filled. Merely
stop the servant when your glass is
half filled, thus preventing comment and
complete waste at one and the same
time. You must not call the servants,
but endeavor to beckon them to you with
the head and eyes, not with the finger.
Never speak louder than will allow of a
comprehension of what you are saying.
Do not toy with articles on the table, and
when the hands are not employed in eating
they must be kept in the lap. Don’t
put the elbows on the table. Reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is not to be indulged in at the table, unless
it is a letter or special communication,
when you must beg pardon for your
rudeness. Do not leave the table before
the rest have finished except in case of
necessity, and then by permission only,
always excusing yourself. When remaining
till the finish, never rise till the host or
hostess or both have signified that the meal
is at an end, by rising first.</p>

<p class="sec">15. There is one custom in this work
which above all others is essential to
every man who has any desire to play
the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of a thorough social success, and
that requirement is dancing. There is
not one thing which a society gentleman
performs, which gives so much enjoyment
not only to himself, but to others.
Nothing is more closely criticized, nothing
more prominent when in execution;
nothing more benefiting as an exercise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and nothing more satisfactory to the performer,
than dancing. By that word is
meant any performance which has the
name of dance, and which has the
requisites of “grace,” “ease,” and
“perfect performance.” To be a perfect
dancer the above expressions in reference
to your dancing should be won from
your admirers. Do not think, because
you have an idea of how to dance, that
you really do so perfectly. The first
requirement to good dancing is grace.
If you are graceful you cannot appear
awkward to on-lookers, for your step is
firm, body quiet, and arms still. The
arm is never pumped, and the feet are
barely lifted off the floor. To have ease,
a dancer should appear confident of his
ability, and show that ability by a correct
and actual performance of the dance in the
above-explained graceful way. To have
a perfect performance of a dance, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of the former requirements are to be exercised,
with these additional requisites,
viz.: use a long decided glide, never jump
or hop, always reverse equally as much
as you turn the original way, keep to
the side of the room, direction to the
right from the entrance. Do not collide
with other couples, or at least protect
your partner from sudden collisions, and
on no account allow her to slip.</p>

<p>The right hand should be at the lady’s
back, between the lower ends of the
shoulder-blades, and should always carry
a silk handkerchief. Never in dancing
hold a lady close to you, for it is the most
disagreeable position for her, and looks
decidedly improper. Hold your partner at
all times at arms’ length; this gives you
freedom of speech, space to use the feet,
and allows you to glide more easily. In
a waltz, always take a long, sweeping
glide, with as little rise as possible. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
step between a Boston dip and the Philadelphia
glide, if used as a sort of an imperceptible,
sweeping dip, will appear to
great advantage on the floor. A Polka
should either be glided or walked through;
never skip, and do not take too long a
step, and do away entirely with all fancy
variations of the dance. Keep strictly to
the original Polka form and you will avoid
all awkward appearances. The same rule
applies to the Yorke, Galop, etc. The
Schottische is a beautiful dance, if performed
gracefully as in the waltz, only
much more care should be exercised in the
forward steps. Do not use that once popular,
but awkward manner of skipping in
this dance, but the more modern three
running steps. Those familiar with all
these popular dances will comprehend
the importance of my criticisms. The Caprice
is the combination dance of waltz
and polka, and necessitates more care and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
attention than any other. Nothing but
the glide step should be used in this
dance.</p>

<p class="sec">16. Balls, Dancing Classes, Theater
Parties, Receptions.—These may all be
given by gentlemen, if they have married
ladies as patronesses. Theater parties
can be followed by dinners at the popular
restaurants, the chaperon attending.
If the party occupies more than one box,
an equal number of chaperons should
accompany it.</p>

<p class="sec">17. Bowling—Card-playing.—In bowling,
a gentleman should keep the score,
notify the ladies of their turns as they
come round, hand them the balls—not
too large, but heavy enough to be thrown
with ease and effect. See that they enjoy
the game thoroughly, or else cease the
sport. If you notice fatigue in a lady’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
manner, ask her to desist. Many
sprains, dislocations, and twists are the
result of attempting to throw balls with
tired wrists. A gentleman can organize
a bowling club under the supervision of
a chaperon attending each meeting.</p>

<p>At cards, he pays strict attention to
those playing; he endeavors to make the
games pleasant. He should never look
over another’s hand of cards; and, above
all, should never cheat. He should never
gamble and bet on cards, nor allow games
of that kind in his house.</p>

<p class="sec">18. Musicales—Matinée Parties.—Gentlemen
attend these either as escorts or
alone. They are at liberty to give them
whenever they desire to do so. They
must always have a patroness or chaperon
present.</p>

<p class="sec">19. (1) When asked to participate in
amateur theatricals, do not unhesitatingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
accept the invitation, but first consider
your ability, not only to act the part
tendered you, but that which is of more
importance, viz., to be able to act gracefully,
and carry it out in all its perfection;
for it is only of too frequent occurrence
that young men readily accept, confident
of being able to memorize their part,
disregarding the fact that memorizing is
not acting. After having accepted an invitation
to act, being of fair ability so to do,
be careful to pay strict attention to your
part, and be punctual at all the rehearsals.
Gentlemen can organize amateur
theatrical clubs among themselves at
discretion, but on no occasion should
ladies be included without a chaperon
at hand.</p>

<p>(2) Never offer to recite, and if asked
to do so, decline, unless you are sure
of what you are about to recite. Do
not make your recitations too lengthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and not too dramatic. Be sure that your
gestures are fitted for the words used;
make them few, but telling. Do not
hurry through a piece; and above all, do
not shout; suit the voice to the size of
the room or hall in which you are reciting.
If encored, acknowledge such by another
piece, or repetition of the first; but to
further applause, merely bow.</p>

<p class="sec">20. Breakfasts can be given at any time
within the hours of eight and twelve <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span>,
to gentlemen, or ladies and gentlemen, a
chaperon being present for the latter.
Invitations for these, as for any other
event, should be answered within the
customary time—two weeks before the
occurrence; or, if the invitation is later
than two weeks before date of breakfast,
an immediate reply is necessary.</p>

<p class="sec">21. When in company never offer to
sing unless you are perfectly confident of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
your ability to satisfy the expectations
of those present. If asked to sing, unless
of ability to do so, be not too ready
to accept the invitation, but wait till it is
tendered you again, so that, in case of
failure, you be not looked so unfavorably
upon as if you had accepted readily; the
same rule applies to playing upon instruments.
When singing or playing reply to
only one encore; to more, merely bow or
offer your excuses.</p>

<h3 id="ACTIONS_OUTDOORS">ACTIONS OUTDOORS</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> When walking alone a quick
step is to be taken; the toes must be
turned out. Never run into a person, if
ordinary care can prevent it, and especially
give way to a lady, no matter how
you may meet. Always keep to the
right of the sidewalk, and never pass in
front of a lady coming at right angles
at a street corner, unless a distance of six
feet intervene between said lady and the
crossing-point when you reach it. In
bowing when alone the hat should be
carried quickly down to the right, or left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
if left-handed, till the back of the hand
strikes the hip, then slowly replaced on
the head. The taking-off of the hat is
to be accompanied by a slight forward
inclination of the body and a smile of
recognition.</p>

<p>Unless the cause of the act is known
to the lady as well as yourself, never cut
her, that is, do not look at her and refuse
absolutely to return her bow, but recognize
it in an indifferent manner sufficient
to convey the fact that something is
wrong, and that the return bow was
forced, while still it is polite. If you know
a lady whom you dislike and have no desire
to recognize, never look at her in passing,
as you would thus invite recognition,
and would be exceedingly impolite in cutting
her. When you meet a person walking,
and that awkward dodging in the
effort to pass occurs, always stop and
turn slightly to the right till the other has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
passed on. If it be a lady, the expression
“Pardon” is to be used as she passes.
If you step on a man’s foot, address him
with an apology merely; if on a lady’s, the
apology must be accompanied by a slight
bow. Never carry a parcel of any kind:
if a hat is to be taken to the store, carry it
in a leather case; if articles of wear, carry
them in a satchel. Do not wear too large
a boutonnière; a few dozen violets or two
or three pinks, or a few sprays of lily
of the valley, or a few pansies, or a very
small red rosebud for afternoon, and as
few leaves as possible. For the evening
a few sprays of hyacinth or lily of the
valley is the only proper buttonhole
bouquet.</p>

<p class="sec">2. When walking with a lady keep
either a military step, or if her step is
too short for your comfort, then take a
Newport drag pace, taking care that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
body does not rise much, thus preventing
a see-saw appearance. Always walk on
the side nearest the curbstone, except
in the case of a very crowded street,
when it may be the most convenient for
the lady to walk on your right. A distance
of half a foot should be kept between
the lady and yourself at all times
when the walk is not crowded; this is
necessary always in the daytime, and
also in the evening unless the acquaintance
is such as permits taking arms.
Never lock arms in the daytime. Always
pay attention if your companion is speaking;
your mind should not be distracted
by persons or objects passing; there is
nothing more unsatisfactory and disagreeable
to a young lady than for her to realize
that she is unheard and unheeded.
When with a lady it is unnecessary to
stop at all to permit another lady to pass
when coming at right angles, as is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
when alone. When raining always
hold the umbrella; when sunny never
offer to, or hold a parasol, unless expressly
requested to do so; a sunshade
is for a lady to hold, and looks out of
place in a gentleman’s hand, unless it is
a particularly heavy one, or the wind
is too strong to permit of the lady carrying
it comfortably. If she has a satchel
or large parcel when you meet her, immediately
offer to carry it.</p>

<p class="sec">3. When joining a lady, if coming toward
her, wait till she has passed; then
turning, join her with the usual or intended
salutation, without stopping her.
Never come intentionally face to face to
join her; she will, presumably, think
that you wish to stop, and it is a settled
conclusion that a lady and gentleman
should never stop to talk on the street;
in a party it is permissible only if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
several persons thereof have chanced to
meet, or are in the act of parting. When
joining a lady in the morning on the street
only accompany her a few blocks, for the
morning is shopping-time, and escorts are
seldom desired. Never fail to raise the
hat on leaving a lady on the street, or at
doors or windows. When it is muddy
cross before a lady that she may profit by
your action, by crossing in your foot-prints.
If very muddy offer your hand for
her support in finding good foot-rests.
Never carry the cane in the hand next
the lady if it is possible to carry it in
the other; if not possible, because the
other is the useful one, then it should
be carried under the arm next to her
with that hand placed at the cane-head.
The reason of this rule will be understood
on reflecting, that if the cane is
carried in the useful hand, it must necessarily
be conveyed to the other every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
time a man bows; it is a poor action,
and presents an awkward appearance,
especially if the cane drops. This rule
also applies to umbrellas when rolled. Of
course this is plain, as it is not supposed
that a gentleman when promenading carries
any but these two articles. Never let
a lady carry your cane in the city.</p>

<p>When entering a door or passageway,
allow the lady to precede you, as is done
indoors. When with a lady, and she
bows, your bow should be less marked
than when alone; the hat is to be raised
and carried quickly to the front as low as
the chin, then as speedily replaced. When
you consider the side you occupy, the
advisability of this manner of bowing is at
once seen on reflecting that a sweeping
bow would more or less interfere with
the continuation of your companion’s recognition
of the third party, which is a
complaint the majority of young ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
set up. In giving a lady soda-water or
other cooling drink, do not allow her to
use her own kerchief, but insist upon her
using one of your own; a gentleman
should always carry two. Also, in view
of the fact that many pockets in dresses
are difficult to discover immediately, the
gentleman should thus be prepared for
emergencies. If walking in the afternoon
with a lady, and you are overtaken by
darkness, do not continue, but immediately
board a horse-car, enter a stage, or
have your carriage follow and meet you,
and thus return. This rule is on the
principle that ladies and gentlemen should
not walk the streets after dark, and this
principle is universally approved of by
society. The walk to and from cars to
attend theaters in the evening, is a different
matter entirely, and cannot be offered
in opposition to the above rule (as many
have claimed), as it is confined to only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
few particular streets, and has nothing
whatever to do with avenue promenades;
besides, it is understood that crossing to
theaters is compulsory, and so excusable.
In taking a lady for a walk, you should
always provide her with a fair-sized
bouquet of violets, if popular, or, if not,
of roses to harmonize with her type,
whether blonde or brunette; or any class
of flowers which you know would suit
her taste, provided they are not out of
style, or unsuited to the season or for
street wear, or perhaps too loud for her
general appearance.</p>

<p class="sec">4. When with a lady, always pay her
fare in a public conveyance, at a ticket
office, or gate, or any place where fare is
demanded, unless she has a ticket for the
occasion.</p>

<p>If in the vehicle, at the office, or gate,
or any place requiring the payment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fare, and you meet a lady friend who has
not as yet paid her fare, do not offer to
do so for her, as it is very bad form, and
presents the appearance of a desire on
your part to let people know you have
money, and the act more or less reflects
upon the lady’s purse. If accompanying
a lady into a store, do not offer to buy
her this and that; such an act is simply
out of consideration; it is an affront to
her purse, and she rejects your offer; no
lady would accept it unless for some very
trifling purchase.</p>

<p class="sec">5. When in any crowded public conveyance,
a lady gets in, always rise immediately
and notify her of the vacancy.
Do not think, because you are tired, you
are justified in keeping the seat, for you
do not know but that the lady is just as
tired as yourself. Again, when you see
a small space between two ladies, do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
try to wedge yourself in; it is better to
be uncomfortable yourself, than to cause
discomfort to the ladies. Do not lean
over or against a lady when holding the
strap overhead, and she is seated below.
Always, if next the fare-box, offer to deposit
a lady’s fare, especially in stages.
Never in city conveyances, if a conductor
is at hand, offer your assistance in raising
or lowering a window, but solicit the
conductor to do it for you; if none is upon
or in the conveyance, then lend your help.</p>

<p class="sec">6. When asking a lady to drive, do so
only on an advanced acquaintance, and do
not keep her out after dark. Take care
not to allow the whip to dangle in her
face, and, in urging on the horses, do so
in an easy manner, without that sudden
start which throws the lady so violently
back in her seat. Do not talk about
horses; it is a very poor subject, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
savors of poor taste. In calling for a lady
do not keep her waiting, but have the
vehicle at the door on time. If possible
to leave the reins loose on the horses,
step out and help the lady into the vehicle,
then pass round to the other side and
take your seat, carefully adjusting the
lap-robe over both. Do not keep up a
continuous chuckle to the horses, as it is
a very monotonous sound, but use the
whip. A full driving suit should always
be worn if a lady accompanies you.
Always wear gloves in driving. If you
have spirited horses to handle, it is not
necessary while driving to take off the
hat when recognizing a person; a smile
and an inclination of the head are sufficient,
for taking off the hat interferes considerably
with your management of the animals,
and has often resulted in serious
accidents. Do not take a lady riding in
the morning. The afternoon from three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
till five is the proper time. Never on any
account drive on Sunday. Never take a
lady in a light wagon or buggy, or out
with fast horses, in the city, for it is not
stylish; in fact, such turnouts are common,
as in use only by sporting men or
horse lovers.</p>

<p class="sec">7. Riding should be confined to the
morning as much as possible, and a complete
outfit worn upon all occasions.
Especially is this urged when with a lady.
Always keep head and neck of your own
horse beyond your companion’s, if a lady,
in view of being able and prepared to
assist her in case of fright or accident to
her horse. Always assist her in mounting
and alighting from her horse.</p>

<p class="sec">8. Sailing is a pastime which can be
indulged in at leisure by a gentleman
who knows a thing or two about such
pleasure; whether he has confidence in
his ability or not, if he ventures upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that pleasure he does so at his own risk.
But when he has a lack of knowledge,
and lack of confidence in his ability to
handle a boat, not under any consideration
should he venture to invite a lady to
accompany him. To take ladies sailing,
when you are ignorant of the methods of
handling sailing craft, is a risk that often
has frightful results; these have been
often seen, where summer men who
know positively nothing about the art
of sailing have issued invitations, and
ventured on their perilous, uncertain
pleasure. Always take a skipper, and
no danger will arise. Take care to look
first after the comfort of the ladies, and
always provide cushions, field-glasses, and
especially ice-water in view of a calm.
This latter is very often neglected, to the
great distress of the ladies when the boat
is becalmed. The writer can safely make
this suggestion, as he had such an experience
himself.</p>

<h3 id="PERSONAL_APPEARANCE">PERSONAL APPEARANCE</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> The hands should always be
kept clean. Do not think because you have
gloves on that you are safe in neglecting
your hands. You may be suddenly called
upon to perform some act which would
necessitate taking off the gloves, thus exposing
soiled hands. The nails should be
kept perfectly clean and projecting about
one-twelfth of an inch from the tender
flesh and not too pointed, and are to be
only slightly polished. All hang-nails
should be cut off, and advanced flesh
pushed back from the root of the nails.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Do not wear too many rings. A gentleman
should never have on more than two,
and those to be placed one on each hand.
Always place them on the fingers next
the little ones. Large diamonds should
not be worn; one carat is the usual
weight. Also, do not wear broad bands
of gold, they are very common-looking
on a gentleman; a seal-ring or intaglio is
quite sufficient. Never wear bracelets, it
is exceedingly effeminate. And, above all,
do not wear ladies’ rings.</p>

<p class="sec">2. The face, if without a growing
beard or moustache, should be kept clean.
This can best be done by a light shave. Do
not shave too close; to be sure it appears
more free of hair for the time being,
but then, as the hair grows out, eruptions
cover the face, especially the neck; thus
for a few hours’ clean appearance you
undergo several days’ discomfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">3. The teeth should be kept clean,
white, and polished. It is necessary that
they be kept clean, as odors from them
sometimes give the impression of a
disordered stomach, and makes conversation
at close quarters exceedingly
disagreeable.</p>

<p class="sec">4. The hair should be carefully brushed,
with a neat part, the sides at the front
being slightly raised and pushed back.
The hair can be parted on either the left,
right, or center of the head, but it should
never be flattened and plastered down, as
the appearance is very weakening to the
character of the face. Leave such a fad to
those of bad taste, who have nothing else
to do but corrupt the standing customs.</p>

<p class="sec">5. Do not, no matter how much displeased,
at any time wear a scowl or
severe expression; it does you no good as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to others, for they do not know the cause
thereof, and they naturally conclude
you to be of a disagreeable disposition.
Equally true is it that the face should be
free from that incessant smiling which
overspreads the countenances of so many.
The face should possess neither one of
these expressions, but present a set, firm
appearance, conveying no idea of the
thoughts of the mind. Outward causes
are exceptions to the changes of facial
expressions. When talking, care should
be taken not to accompany the words
with distortions of the face. The mouth
should not be opened too wide, nor the
tongue stuck out. Never bite the lips or
pick the teeth, as both distort the face.
Never use the eyes in a flirtatious manner,
as it is very poor taste and shows conceit.
Also, do not glance at a strange lady in a
steady or impertinent manner; least of
all on the street or in public vehicles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">6. Your position should always be
as dignified as possible; if sitting, the
body should be held upright and the arms
gracefully placed, and not twisted or hung
over the back of the chair. Always
face the person whom you are addressing.
When standing, your position
must be straight, shoulders back, and
head well up. The legs to be close together
or one slightly advanced, in a position
of rest. The arms can be carried
either by locking hands behind the back,
or in front, or they can be folded upon the
chest; either way can be made to appear
graceful. When walking, the body is
carried as in standing, and the busy
hand must carry its contents as gracefully
as possible, while the other hand is
allowed to hang by the side, moving only
with the motion of the body. Both, if
free, must hang thus; never put them in
the pockets.</p>

<h3 id="HABITS">HABITS</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Smoking should be confined
entirely to a studio, smoking-room, drawing-room,
or library, when ladies are, or intend
to be, in the vicinity later, and should
never be indulged in, even in the places
mentioned above, if the ladies are present,
without their unanimous consent thereto.</p>

<p>Smoking in the street is also objected to,
exception being made when on the front
platforms of cars, when a gentleman
should make it his duty to see that the
smoke does not prove disagreeable to
ladies in the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">2. Drinking to excess is not the habit
of a gentleman. Drink should be taken
only in moderation, especially at dinner
parties when ladies are present. Do not
boast of your fondness for the beverage.
If you chance to be at all under the influence
of liquor, or even if you have merely
a strong odor of it on the breath, do not
attend a reception or dance, as such an
odor is not perfume to the partners with
whom you may dance or converse.</p>

<p class="sec">3. Chewing tobacco or other stuff
manufactured for the same purpose should
never be indulged in by a gentleman, no
matter where he is. Spitting must not
be practised in the presence of ladies,
and should be done away with entirely
unless alone and out of sight of others.
Clearing the throat should not be done
in ladies’ company, and be careful not
to allow indications of indigestion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
rise noisily in the throat. And lastly, do
not hiss through the teeth or hum to
yourself in company.</p>

<p class="sec">4. Do not, no matter how cramped
you may be, stretch in the presence of
ladies, and not at all at the table, even if
alone. Yawning should be confined to
your own presence strictly, or, if it is
irrepressible, place the fingers before the
mouth.</p>

<h3 id="CONVERSATION">CONVERSATION</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Never use sarcasm in direct
conversation, as it is but a veiled form of
insult. Do not use deceit, especially in conversing
with a lady; also, avoid prevarication,
as such is bad policy. Do not boast, it
is an absurd habit to fall into. Too many
puns or jokes become monotonous; jokes
should not be told in reference to a person
present, unless the acquiescence of
the party be first received.</p>

<p class="sec">2. Your grammar should be of the best,
and your words selected with great care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Large words should be used very seldom
unless the topic of conversation calls for
them.</p>

<p class="sec">3. Laughter should never be forced; if
you are not amused, merely smile. When
laughing at a small matter do so in a light,
sincere way; when amused by some
good joke or occurrence, laugh heartily
but not too loudly; merely convey the
fact that the joke or event is appreciated.
This rule should apply at all times when
ladies are present.</p>

<p class="sec">4. Never flatter a lady, for it is the
poorest substitution for a sensible topic
that was ever thought of in society. It is
disliked by ladies and gentlemen alike,
and it shows insincerity in its every use.
If you desire to say something nice to a
person, make use of more serious expressions,
commonly known as compliments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
for, if you intend to compliment and
speak too sweetly, it is not such, but flattery,
you are making use of. Only compliment
when a person deserves it, and
do not do so too often.</p>

<p class="sec">5. In society one should always be
prepared for impromptu conversation, or
small talk, and should always have plenty
of it in stock; that is, not the whole substance
of the expected conversation, but
subjects upon which you can converse at
a moment’s notice. At receptions, teas,
dinners, dances, or any other entertainment,
the topics should be select, and
the oral abilities prepared to discuss them
in a free and familiar way. Such topics
might well be classed under the simple
heads of Art of latest Artists, Receptions,
Teas, etc., and especially Latest Novels,
then also Plays and the criticisms, or
Noted People of the Day. You will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
any one of these sufficient for short conversation.
Literature and grave subjects
would prove too extensive. Try not to
criticize people severely, and do not speak
on any subject which, after a few remarks,
appears uninteresting or distasteful to the
person conversing with you. When a
subject has been once discussed and
abandoned by all, it is bad taste to return
to it during that same conversation or in
the same company.</p>

<h3 id="CORRESPONDENCE_AND_INVITATIONS">CORRESPONDENCE AND INVITATIONS</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Correspondence is a thing
which every man should be able to do
well in all its branches, whether social or
business, whether formal or otherwise,
whether brief or extended in its subject-matter.
A gentleman should always be
able to write sensible letters, and to the
point, without deviating from the general
topic. When corresponding with other
men keep strictly, unless with a very close
friend, to the subject in question. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
when writing to ladies the rule is different.
To adhere so exactly to the topic of discussion
is significant of a desire to have
the matter through with. Always add
further casual remarks tending to show
an interest beyond the duty of correspondence.
The ladies’ writing rule is
just the reverse.</p>

<p>It does very well to insert, here and
there, witty remarks to break the monotony
of a lengthy epistle. Above all, it is
advised to abstain from putting in writing
any words imparting affection or soliciting
such from the lady. Write your letter
in one complete part; that is, let all
you have to say be penned upon any
number of sheets you may desire, but be
sure it is between the head address and
your signature. Never add a postscript;
this in letters, like a parenthesis in sentences,
has the appearance of poor construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not write crosswise on the paper,
and avoid blotting the same. Also see
that you never write to a lady on office
paper, or any which is ink-lined, for your
social corresponding paper should always
have a crest or monogram at the top, and
such would not appear well or to advantage
on that which is lined. If you desire
ruled paper, let the lines be such as
are pressed into it during manufacture.
Lastly, never use hotel paper, except in
the summer, and then only when traveling
or visiting without a trunk, which
should always contain every necessity of
a trip.</p>

<p>If it is formal, a lady’s letter should
be answered immediately, if there is the
least hint of a reply in it, but without
such hint the gentleman must not
answer. If it is informal, he must, if
requested to reply, do so immediately,
otherwise he may suit himself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
within a limit of one month; later,
politeness would be at stake. But the
lady should not be expected to answer
in either case to your letter unless she
feels so disposed, or you show good
reasons why she should, and expressly
request her to do so.</p>

<p>Formal correspondence can be indulged
in between any persons who may be
related, very dear friends, or even mere
acquaintances. With the first two classes,
a gentleman can correspond formally at
any and all times, unless expressly solicited
not to do so by the lady’s parents, or
guardians, or herself. But in the last case
he must have a request to offer or an
answer to return, and it should be very
formal, implying by its very subject-matter
that necessity caused the correspondence.
When writing a formal note to
a lady acquaintance, without her consent,
merely sign your name to the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and place therein your card, such as is
described in Sec. 8, Actions Indoors. Never
write your address beneath the signature,
or, as is sometimes done, above the head
address, in this class of notes.… But
informal and lengthy correspondence only
pertains to, and can be exercised at all
times by, very dear friends, <i lang="fr">fiancés</i>, or
very dear relatives. Acquaintances must
be subjected to the rule of formality of
correspondence, till they have reached
the relation of friend, which can be acquired
only after eight or ten meetings,
when there has been sufficient conversation
to establish what the parties mutually
agree to constitute fast friendship.</p>

<p class="sec">2. Invitations are so many and varying
in their nature, that it is generally difficult
to say what kind of a reply, and
how soon, should be given. But all
can be summed up in a few divisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
viz.: Reception, Dance, and Wedding
invitations. (<i>a</i>) Reception invitations are
never to be replied to, unless accompanied
with an informal invitation to an
after-reception dance, bearing an R. S. V.
P., when a few days can be permitted to
elapse before replying thereto. (<i>b</i>) A
wedding invitation, like the reception,
needs no reply, except under the same
conditions as annexed to reception invitations.
But dances are the subjects for
which dozens of different kinds of invitations
are issued, when it is decidedly
difficult to ascertain the exact time, or
answer as desired by the inviter. The
answer depends upon the number of inviters
included in the invitation; the time
upon the number of days intervening
before the date of the event; if two weeks,
the regular time allotted, then an immediate
reply is necessary (exceptions in subscription
dances). If two or three ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
or gentlemen, or both, are the inviters,
then address the reply to the one so
selected as secretary for the reception of
replies, and of course sign your name on
the completion of the reply; then in the
left-hand lower corner, pen, “Politeness
to”; then write, one beneath the other,
the names of all the inviters, including
the secretary last; this shows that the
reply is politely tendered to all. In a
subscription dance, an invitation for all
and every date of dances is usually sent
out six weeks before date of first meeting,
in which case three or four weeks at
the most can be allowed to pass; but
no matter when the invitation is received,
if two or six weeks prior to the first meeting,
always reply at least two weeks
before such first date. Dinners, teas,
breakfasts, etc., are the same as dances as
to time and answer. Invitations by card
to call are not to be answered, but should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
be acknowledged in person, as soon after
their reception as possible. Invitations
to subscription dances need only be addressed
to the secretary or inviter.</p>

<h3 id="PERSONAL_ACTIONS">PERSONAL ACTIONS</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> When a gentleman accepts
the honored position of escort he is supposed
to do so willingly, and with the intention
of fulfilling its many requirements.
Do not accept and accompany a lady to her
intended destination, and continually show
any displeasure in your position. Pay strict
attention to her, and leave her only when
she is engaged in some dance or occupation
with another partner. Young ladies take
escorts in substitution for a brother or
relative, and when so taking expect to
find them congenial and as equal to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
duties as any brother or relative would
be. When asking a gentleman as escort
the lady is expected to furnish the carriage
if it is her desire to ride; it is not
necessary for the gentleman to bring
her flowers in return for her kindness,
but an after-gift of the same will suffice.
When asking a lady to give you the
pleasure of her company for any event,
you must, of course, expect to pay all
expenses; if in the evening, and she is an
old acquaintance, always expect to furnish
a carriage. If only an acquaintance, and it
is necessary to use a carriage, then a chaperon
should be brought with you. But
the cars are generally the mode of travel
which can be used if a chaperon is not
desired.</p>

<p>Never take advantage of your situation
when in a carriage alone with a lady, by
addressing her in any way too familiar
to be polite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">2. Extravagance is one of the greatest
faults into which young and old persist
in falling. Very few society men know
what economy means. So to point out
a few ways by which extravagance may
be at least modified by gentlemen: (<i>a</i>)
It is very poor taste for a person to
show by his attire extravagant inclinations.
Do not dress too gaudily, or
change the suits more than is ordinarily
necessary for special occasions. Let your
dress be not too costly, not too loud, but
neat, of the styles described in Part I.
of this book, and do away with too
great a variety of top and over coats,
neckties, patent leather shoes (for walking),
and, above all, elaborately figured
waistcoats, also elaborate canes. They
all combine not only to appear extravagant,
but destroy the effect of simple
elegance. (<i>b</i>) Do not spend money
for a thing unless it is necessary for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
own good or that of a relation. Presents
given by a single man should be simple
and of slight cost.</p>

<p>If engaged the rule is less strict; but if
married a man should not only teach himself
the law of economy, but also his wife
and children. Such gifts as candy, flowers,
jewelry, etc., should be given only by
very dear friends, which relation permits
such presents to be of slight cost, while
they are appreciated as if of great cost.
Costly gifts to acquaintances are a gross
extravagance.</p>

<p class="sec">3. Kissing is a pleasure which is not
to be indulged in except among dear
relatives, the family, wife, or your <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>.
Never kiss or embrace a person outside of
these exceptions, no matter how old friends
they may be. No lady would allow you
such a privilege, and if she should so far
forget her standing as to permit the act,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
you would be rude, exceedingly so, and
no gentleman, to take advantage of her
forgetfulness. Never, on any account, kiss
or embrace the persons, as stated above,
in a public place,—it is common. No one
knows your relationship, and no one the
length of time of separation; besides, the
act of kissing is very undignified and
ungraceful. Of course these rules only
apply to gentlemen; they are not enforceable
in respect to ladies, as the feminine
sex is supposed to be more demonstrative.
Familiarity, though allowed, breeds
contempt by degrees.</p>

<p class="sec">4. Familiarity is a subject upon which
the majority of society men can discourse
fluently, so practised are they in the art.
In fact, society is infected with this disease.
It reigns on all occasions, be they
private or public. It is found in the most
aristocratic circles, as in those of less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
refinement. Why should this continue?
It should not. Both ladies and gentlemen
use it; but of gentlemen, alone, I now
speak. Freedom of speech and freedom
of manner constitute the general heads of
familiarity. (<i>a</i>) Freedom of manner has
been partly defined under the heads of
kissing and embracing. Do not on any
account allow of any rude actions on your
part; always keep a polite distance from a
lady, and do not, if you take her hand,
retain too long a hold thereof, or press
it with your own; in fact, never touch
a lady unless she is related to you, under
the heads set forth in Section 3, Personal
Actions, unless it becomes absolutely
necessary; then do it in the most polite
manner possible. (<i>b</i>) Freedom of speech
is the most important head of familiarity,
and includes many classes of rudeness.
Do not be impertinent in your
remarks to ladies, ask no personal questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
do away with rude speech; seek
not to impart to her that which she should
not know, or tries to turn a deaf ear to.
Improper remarks are poison from the
tongue, and tend to ruin your reputation
in her estimation, as a gentleman, sooner
or later. It is no excuse if she tolerates
your advances or not,—a gentleman is a
gentleman, and should remain so. Not
only is this rule applicable to acquaintances,
but it should be strictly observed
in your own family. Your sisters should
be as acquaintances as respects your
behavior, and your mother and father
should command respect in your every
word or action.</p>

<p class="sec">5. A gentleman, because he is married,
should not suppose himself fitted for the
position of chaperon on occasions where
it is necessary to leave the city, or it is an
evening affair; on the contrary, it is his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
duty to refuse acceptance of such a position,
unless himself and wife act as the
chaperons. If single, he should never
offer his services as chaperon. He may
be such in the daytime, within the city,
acting as a guide or protector of his companion;
but this is a very weak form of
chaperonage compared to that customary
in society, which form generally concerns
only evening or out-of-town events,
when a stricter rule is applied, under the
conditions of which a gentleman can never
be a chaperon. It must be remembered
that though guide and protector are
the true meanings of the word chaperon,
yet, as far as a gentleman can exercise
that right, he can be no more than an
escort.</p>

<p class="sec">6. A gentleman should shake hands as
seldom as possible. On introduction and
at parting should be the chief occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for the act. This rule refers only to your
own sex. With ladies it is far stricter.
You should not shake hands on introduction
to ladies, nor at parting; but at
the next meeting, or subsequent ones, if
they appear desirous of such a cordial
greeting, grasp their hand, for it is at the
option of a lady whether or not the hands
should come in contact with each other;
but never shake at parting. When taking
a lady’s hand, grasp it firmly, but gently,
just sufficient pressure to convey the feeling
of cordiality, nothing more, and raising
her hand to the height of her waist,
shake it gently two or three times, then
release it; never hold it while speaking,
and do not attempt that awkward, lately
originated style of raising the hands
above the face, with the fingers twisted
out of shape; it is clumsy, decidedly
ridiculous in appearance, and very uncomfortable
for the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">7. Never kiss a lady’s hand when in
public, and never privately, unless engaged
or very much attached to her, and
not then unless she is willing to undergo
the torture.</p>

<p>Do not, as in hand-kissing, throw
kisses to a person in public, and not at all
unless under the conditions stated above.</p>

<p class="sec">8. When engaged a gentleman should
devote all his spare moments to his
<i lang="fr">fiancée</i>. He should compel himself to forsake
other ladies’ society, allowing himself
to be thrown therein only when accompanying
his intended to entertainments
or dances, and then should control himself,
so as to give no cause of jealousy by
his actions or apparent interest in others
of the fair sex. He should give all presents
to her, take her to all the entertainments
and dances, and, in fact, let her find
him always devotion in everything. Clubs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
should be partially or wholly neglected
for her. Even under the circumstances,
familiarity should be guardedly exercised,
especially with her family.</p>

<p class="sec">9. Introductions are the most important
of any of the numerous acts of society,
constituting a custom established by long
and frequent usage. It is easy to introduce,
no matter how or in what manner
it is done, and ninety-nine per cent. of
introductions are either improperly conducted
or a mere mention of names. To
constitute a proper introduction there
must be three requisites, viz.: Sufficient
language to imply an introduction, an
objective name and a subjective name
each distinctly pronounced. That is to
say: the object is the person to whom the
subject is presented; second, the subject
of the introduction is the one whom you
present. You must pronounce both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
names distinctly. First, be sure that
both are aware of your intention and
secure of each other’s attention, then
proceed by saying: <i>(Ex.)</i> “Miss Smith
[object], please allow me to present Mr.
Brown [subject].” This is all, and it is as
simple as can be; yet people will mumble
and stammer and stumble through
an introduction as if it were the most
difficult of performances. If the object or
subject of an introduction is a sister,
brother, or parent, do not say, as many
do—Miss Smith, my brother, or my sister,
naming the relation only; but say
always—Miss Smith, my brother, Mr.
Brown. This rule is in view of the
fact that the introducer’s name is not
always familiar to the object. Never
mention the name of the subject first.
When introducing extend the right or
left hand as a gesture towards the person
whom you are introducing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>It is important to make introductions
carefully and at the proper time. Do
not suffer a person with whom you are
acquainted to remain in your own party
without introducing him to every member
of that party. When talking to a person,
and joined by a third, immediately introduce.
The rules of introduction should
be strictly observed in regard to ladies.
As much as possible avoid introducing on
the street, and when doing so do not stop
the objective persons, but join them as
explained in Section 4, Actions Outdoors,
whether lady or gentleman, and present
the subject while walking. Do not introduce
to young ladies under age without
the chaperon’s or guardian’s consent, and
ladies of age without their approval having
first been received. Do not present
or attempt to present a man of whose
character or reputation you are doubtful;
for thousands of serious results have been
thus occasioned.</p>

<h3 id="PROPOSING">PROPOSING</h3>

<p>A gentleman, when he is sure that his
attachment to a lady has attained perfection,
and is positive of being ever afterward
so attached to her as to permit of
no disturbance of that affection by force
of circumstances, may then and only then
have the right of asking for her hand in
marriage. It is a much-mooted question
whether a gentleman should ask the
parents’ or guardian’s consent to the proposal,
if the young lady or himself or both
are under age. If we follow the continental
rule, this is the proper action in the
matter. This course is certainly more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
honorable. It matters not which parent
is first consulted, though the father is
preferred. The parent, or parents, or
guardian may be consulted in person or
by letter. After their consent has been
gained, the proposal is made to the
woman chosen. If she refuses, then
nothing more on the subject need be said
till subsequent proposals are attempted.
A refusal need not be reported to the
parents or guardians. If she accepts, he
immediately informs them. If both parties
are of age, or independent, it is not
essential to a proposal that parents or
guardians should be consulted.</p>

<h4>HOW TO PROPOSE</h4>

<p>Remember that you are a gentleman,
and success will be yours if the lady possesses
any love or affection in her heart
for you. It is best not to force your suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
upon a woman, for such engagements
often cause either a breaking of the engagement
between the parties, or unhappiness
to both. It is far better to undergo
the pain of a refusal for the time being,
and endeavor to gain her affection afterward
in view of another and more successful
trial.</p>

<p>Never propose in any way but in person.
Letters are very poor mediums of the
affection; besides, a woman prefers personal
tenders of affection. When you
propose, never do so unless alone with
the lady, either in-doors or out, but
not in public, when promenading, driving,
or riding, or on any occasion where
she cannot give you her undivided attention.</p>

<p>A proposal is, next to a marriage, the
most important event in a man’s life, and,
if looked favorably upon by the woman,
is such also in her life. Therefore take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
plenty of time to think over the seriousness
of the step; consider how much
interest the lady has previously shown
in you, and the result to your feelings if
refused.</p>

<p>If a lady appears uncertain in her
answer, you can depend upon it that she is
weighing in golden scales the results, the
strength of her own affection; and, above
all, you may justly and correctly construe
that the greater cause of her hesitation
is uncertainty of your regard for her,
whether true of the heart, or falsely stated.
For no woman cares to have a man know
that she entertains affection for him unless
she is confident he will appreciate it.
Thus if it be not a positive refusal, but
hesitation only, always be determined,
and decide for her by describing the
happiness that only you could furnish
her. These arguments, if anything would
avail, will help to strengthen and control
her decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Always plead your cause with eyes and
speech only. When accepted it is left to
the option of the suitor as to what mode
of procedure will best express his delight
and happiness. But perhaps for those of
timid and bashful nature it is advisable to
suggest a standard course of action, viz.:
when the lady replies affirmatively, immediately
clasp her in your arms; this
is not, for true lovers, a very embarrassing
position. Let the embrace be
gentle, simply to signify and give strength
and proof of your affectionate expressions
prior to the acceptance.</p>

<p>Always stand when proposing, as it
lends dignity to the occasion and allows of
more freedom in expressing the feelings;
besides, it savors of very little earnestness
to remain in any other attitude while
making so important a confession.</p>

<p>Before proposing it would be best to
ascertain how the lady regards you in any
particular light. If she speaks favorably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of any one of your fascinations, then on
that foundation you may attempt to build
your future happiness. Do not propose
in an uncertain manner, bashfully, or yet
too boldly. Be serious, desirous, and
speak to the point; confess all your
feelings, state everything correctly and
truly, and in as telling language as you
can possibly command. Do not laugh or
smile, or cause it to appear an amusing
matter. It would be utterly impossible
to illustrate the language of proposals,
for many and varied are the methods
employed and the language used. But
if a gentleman adheres to all I have stated
on the subject, it will only be fate which
will prevent the fulfilment of his anticipations.
A gentleman never makes free
with the lady, at the time of the acceptance,
beyond the conditions stated
herein. And from the moment she
accepts him, through all her life he must
be constant in his attention to her.</p>

<h3 id="PRESENTS">PRESENTS</h3>

<p>Under the general head of presents
is classed anything given to another at
one’s own expense. Give presents to your
own family, relatives, <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, or very old
friends, but not to mere acquaintances.</p>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Flowers, though short-lived,
are nevertheless the most beautiful gift one
person can make to another. It shows
taste and a love of nature, and nothing
finds more appreciation in the hearts of
womankind than flowers. Be careful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
your selection; suit the color and quality
to the taste and dress of the lady. Have
them tastily laid in a box, loosely, if
merely as a favor; but if for a dance or
entertainment, the best way is to gather
the flowers loosely half-way down the
stems, and tie with ribbon harmonizing in
color, placing at the end of the bouquet a
bunch of leaves to hide the stems. Always
send the flowers in a box; do not
carry them to the lady yourself—if in a
hurry, call a messenger. Flowers may be
sent to any lady, married or maiden,
but never send them as a wedding present.
When desirous of sending flowers
to a lady with whom you are about to
attend an affair, first ascertain whether
she desires to wear flowers, and the color
of the gown she intends wearing. It is
hardly the fashion nowadays to carry
hand-bouquets; only loose flowers to be
worn on the dress should be sent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p class="sec">2. Jewelry should be given as seldom
as possible outside of your own family,
dear relatives, or <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>. If given to others,
it should be very small, cost little, and not
be too elaborate; having merely enough
beauty about it to convey the feeling and
intention of the gift. A costly present
of this class is seldom appreciated as it
should be, unless it is given to a lady
who stands, or intends to stand, in a very
dear position towards you, or to a gentleman
friend of long standing and sincere
friendship. The only exception allowable
for costly gifts of jewelry outside of those
rules already stated is in cases of marriage;
where the act of presentation
of jewels would furnish no ground
of suspicion further than extravagance.
Whether for a wedding or an ordinary gift,
jewelry should always be sent in a box
from the store direct, or by messenger;
never present it in person. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
calling subsequently refuse the acceptation
of thanks.</p>

<p class="sec">3. For bon-bons and elaborate boxes,
also for articles not classed as jewelry, a
much more lenient rule is applied. In fact,
except for mere acquaintances, a present
of this kind may be given to any one,
friend or relative, married or unmarried.
These, too, are not to be delivered in person,
but sent with card from store or by
messenger. In such presents, as in others,
taste and fine judgment should be exercised.
To a gift of any kind whatsoever
an answer should not be expected for
three days.</p>

<p class="sec">4. Photographs should never be solicited
from a mere acquaintance. Wait
till you know a lady well before asking
for her likeness. No gentleman should
be allowed to possess, nor should he
seek to possess, a lady’s picture without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
first having met her at least seven times.
He must first so establish his friendship
with her that when he asks for her likeness
she cannot justly use the common
expression that “he must have her photograph
for fear he might forget her face,”
but would understand that his desire for
it comes straight from the heart, and not
with the intention of adding to a variety
collection. And it is also unnecessary to
comply with a like request from the lady
till of fast acquaintance. An exchange of
photographs is generally the safest way
of overcoming any doubt which may
arise in your mind as to the disposition
which the lady will make of your picture,
for then the maxim can be applied—“It’s
a poor rule which can’t work both
ways.”</p>

<h3 id="GENERAL_POLITENESS">GENERAL POLITENESS</h3>

<p class="sec"><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> A gentleman should always
be perfectly polite with his social inferiors,
no matter how he may be brought in contact
with them, whether he meets them
in company with his equals or inferiors,
or if alone. For though your inferiors,
they deserve respect, and a deviation
from politeness on their account would
cause your politeness towards equals to
appear false, a shield to your true manner.
Always be polite to your inferiors, and it
naturally follows that you will be politeness
itself with your equals. A gentleman
has no superiors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Politeness is called for in every turn
a gentleman may make, whether among
ladies or gentlemen, or inferiors, in society
or in business, among relatives, acquaintances,
friends, or strangers.</p>

<p class="sec">2. An insult is not to be recognized
when offered by an inferior; pay no attention
to such, unless it is followed by
violence, or when it places you in an awkward
position in presence of equals, and
even then, if from one decidedly inferior,
or a woman, do not return it, but summon
the agents of the law to rid you of the
nuisance. If an equal, it is at your own
option whether or not you resent the
insult, which can be done by the use of
irony; thus, though an implied return of
the insult, your resentment is on its face
politeness itself. Duels are not allowable
in America, and seldom in any country.
A deadly insult is now usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
looked upon by society as a just cause of
expulsion of the insulter from its ranks,
as no longer worthy of the name of gentleman;
for modern society is more just
than the society in the days of knighthood,
when a gross insult would be
looked upon with favor, as but a preliminary
to a test of skill at arms. All the
remedy a gentleman has in this age is
either an apology from his opponent, or
the future avoidance and non-recognition
of him, or, in extreme cases, a resort to
the law.</p>

<p class="sec">3. The most indifferent, collected,
firm, and <i lang="fr">blasé</i> of society men are susceptible
to embarrassments. No matter
how sure you may be of being proof
against them, there always comes a time
when the firm foundation is undermined
by a sudden inpour of unforeseen circumstances,
which brings your guarded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
fortified walls of conceit and coolness to
earth, and tends to humble your pride.
Now, many society men hold that a
man should never become embarrassed
under any circumstances. Not so; there
are instances where to remain unmoved
and indifferent to embarrassment would
show an uncultured exercise of politeness.
For example, how could a gentleman,
having spoken to his companion of a third
party in an insulting manner, refrain from
embarrassment when that companion subsequently
turns up and presents the third
person, who thereupon reproaches him for
his prior insinuation and insult? Yet in
ninety-nine cases out of every hundred
the gentle and polite society men remain
unmoved and unembarrassed, making
excuses and stating falsely. Yet they
leave impressions of impoliteness and
rudeness upon the minds of their victims.
Suit the necessity of embarrassment to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
occasion. Only if he has shown marked
impoliteness or rudeness, or both, need a
gentleman show concern subsequent to
his remark or manner.</p>

<p class="sec">4. Temper is the last subject for discussion
here; but it is not by any
means the least in importance. In fact,
if it were not for a proper control
and exercise of temper, there would
hardly be necessity for elucidating half
the subjects already so defined. The
temper should never be displayed under
circumstances pertaining to society proper.
That is, to your equals a tranquil nature
and manner should always be shown, no
matter how trying the position. To inferiors
temper should not be shown while
in sight or hearing of equals, and even
when alone with servants or agents only
in case of breach of duty, and then should
merely be shown sufficiently far to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a reprimand more severe. In fact there
are so many remedies for circumstances
tending to rouse the temper that it should
be done away with as a bad habit. When
you do so far forget your politeness as to
allow the temper to rise, be sure that it is
not directed to a lady.</p>

<h3 id="VISITING">VISITING</h3>

<p>A gentleman should as seldom as possible
offer a regret for an invitation to
visit, and when doing so must see that
his excuse is a good one. Only business,
traveling, and sickness are sufficiently
strong causes of refusal. To offer a
poor excuse is to cause a suspicion of a
dislike on your part for the inviter, his
or her family or home, or perhaps that
you are too little interested in the whole
affair to bother about visiting the person.
Such poor excuses, though apparently
sufficient in your judgment, not only appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
weak to the inviters, but cause them
to neglect you in the future in respect
to visiting. Of course, if you are visiting
or about to visit, an excuse to that
effect is sufficient, provided you explain
that the invitation you have accepted
was received and acknowledged prior to
the one which you are regretting. Your
excuse, when a good one, should be
strong, sincere, and regretfully expressed,
and, above all, never hint that you will
be at liberty for a visit later, or at some
future date. There is such a thing as
being too indifferent in a regret to an
invitation, and also such a thing as showing
in a regret too deep an interest or
anxiety to accept. And this latter is bad
enough without being accompanied by
broad hints. If the first invitation was
sincere and the inviter really desired your
company, you may be sure a second
attempt will be made and another invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
issued. When accepting an invitation,
it is best to adhere strictly to your
acceptation of the kindness and express
such in sincere terms. Do not be too
effusive, but to the point, for an acceptance
is not a letter and should therefore
be short and formal. If a regret, the rule
may be reversed, as, not intending to visit,
you are justified in substituting a letter,
whereas acceptances are followed by the
visit, and a lengthy epistle would be
unnecessary.</p>

<p>After having accepted an invitation, be
sure to take with you a sufficient supply
of clothes for variety, and also that you
may be prepared for emergencies or
a prolongation of your visit. It is very
rude and impolite to inquire in your
note of acceptance as to the length of
time of stay. You may depend upon
it that no person having any knowledge
of society would invite you for, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
most, more than a week, and if longer the
inviter would acquaint you of the fact in
the invitation. But for a week or less the
inviter would neglect to mention any
given time of stay. But it should be
understood that at the close of the second
day the visitor is to remark upon his departure
as fixed for the following day;
then if the host or hostess desire your
presence for a longer period, they will
express themselves to that effect. It is
safer always to take one week’s supply of
linen, in view of such an expression from
them. Of course these rules only apply
to formal invitations between friends of
long standing, but who have been more
or less separated, or friends of late
acknowledgment, or perhaps, in rare
instances, mere acquaintances, and have
nothing whatever to do with fast friendship,
where it would be absolutely impossible
to govern the parties in their manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of recognizing and accepting or regretting
invitations, and their actions subsequent
to their arrival at the place of visitation.
Such an invitation is controlled generally
by the mutual acquiescence and approval
of the parties, and is too informal to
be considered under the head of formal
customs.</p>

<p>Therefore to adhere strictly to the
essential rules for a formal visitor:</p>

<p>A gentleman should make it a rule
to be punctual to the time set for his arrival,
be it morning, afternoon, or evening.
When expected in the morning for breakfast,
and the place of visit is out of town, if
he arrives at his destination earlier than to
his knowledge the family are accustomed
to rise, then he should occupy himself in
some way till it is time to put in an appearance,
that he may be received by the
host or hostess at a reasonable hour.
The first duty of a visitor is to be punctual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to breakfast every morning during
his stay; and more too, he should never
fail to precede the host or hostess or
both (only these), that he may be thus
prepared to receive them with the usual
morning salutation. As to dinner, lunch,
or supper, punctuality is not considered,
as, being in company with his entertainer,
it would be hardly possible for him to be
dilatory.</p>

<p>A gentleman should never wear a dressing
gown or slippers outside of his room,
when visiting or otherwise. He should
never enter the dining-room till the host
or hostess, or both, have preceded him.
Table manners are the same in visiting as
at dinners at home and the like.</p>

<p>After any meal be careful not to appear
uneasy or dissatisfied with the proceedings
of your entertainer; and do not, no
matter how great a desire you may have,
express opinions upon any arrangements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
or suggest any occupation for the consumption
of time, without first being asked for
your advice or opinion; for very often the
host or hostess is led into doing that
which but for your request, and the fact of
your being a visitor, they would never have
thought of or desired to do; so be careful
always to control your desire to make
suggestions. Let your conversation, manners,
and actions be ruled substantially as
in calling. Never remain astir after the
host or hostess, or both, have retired, but
ascend to your own room coincidently
with them and retire immediately. During
a visit a gentleman should acquiesce
in everything requested of him by host or
hostess, unless his opinion is called for,
when he should, in deciding between his
entertainers and others, speak freely but
impartially; but if possible always decline
the honor of judge.</p>

<p>Do not appear at ease or at home beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the unembarrassed exercise of a visitor’s
duties, for such freedom may tend to
cause dislike for you as presuming on
your liberties.</p>

<p>A gentleman should not visit unless he
be prepared, in case of emergencies, for a
request from the hostess, if the host is
absent, or from both if the host is himself
incapable, to act the part of table-host;
and to do this he must be thoroughly
versed in the art of carving and serving the
viands, and in other ways demeaning
himself as is essential to hosts.</p>

<p>In fact, in going on a visit a gentleman
should be proficient in its many requirements.
Such rules as are here laid down
will be sufficient, and will not fail in leading
him safely through the minor branches
of politeness.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
